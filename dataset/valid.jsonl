I've personally been using this method for years, and since last year I've been hosting free online workshops every few months going through the method. I've taken tens of thousands of people through it and people have gotten enormous value from these sorts of exercises. And if you actually do the things we're going to talk about in this video, then this might be the single most impactful video that you've watched this year. Anyway, in this video we are discussing the three step method, which is reflecting, align and plan. Let's dive into it. All right, so step one is to reflect on where you are currently at and do a bit of a mini life audit. Now I have various different ways of doing this, but I'm going to give you two of my favorites. The first one is an exercise called the Wheel of Life. And actually, if you want, you can do this exercise as you're watching along with this video. And the idea is that we are going to draw ourselves a little wheel and we're going to divide it into three categories for work, health and relationships. Now within those three categories, we're going to further subdivide them into another three categories. So within the category of work, we have mission, money and growth. Within health, we've got body, mind and heart. And then within relationships we've got romantic, family and friends. And now that we've got these nine categories, we want to ask ourselves the question that in each of these categories, how satisfied do I currently feel with where my life is at? And you give yourself a Little rating from 0 to 10 in each of these different categories. And it'll give you a bit of a visual representation of which areas of your life, by your own estimation are going well that you are very satisfied with and which areas have room for improvement. I find this personally to be a very good exercise to do whenever I'm feeling any kind of vague sense of unease about my life. Because then it puts actual, somewhat objective, well, subjective numbers on the thing. And then There is a 10th category that I like to add to the list, which is joy. And I would usually put that outside of the wheel because with all this like personal development stuff, if you watch this channel, you probably watch other personal improvement self development channels in it can be very easy to just be so fixated on growth that we forget to actually enjoy the present moment. And sometimes when I want to figure out how I'm Going to change my life in 90 days. It actually becomes less about. I want to improve personal developmentally in any of these particular areas. And it might just be. I actually want to experience more joy and so, you know, reminders to myself to enjoy the present moment and take a step back and to actually rest. Things like that. So the Wheel of life is one very quick and easy way to reflect on where your life is at right now. There is another one that I like. It's a very simple journaling prompt. And you know, you can take a page, you can do this in a physical journal if you want. I like these particular Harry Potter Moleskine journal book thingies. And you basically split the page into four parts. In the first column you have work. In the second column you have life. And then in the first row you have what's working and in the second row you have what's not working. And then you set a timer for five minutes, you put on some vibey background music, and you just sort of fill in a few bullet points in each of these different categories without overthinking it. Now, I have a little rule for myself whenever I do stuff like this, which is that the what's working category has to have at least twice as many things as the what's not working category. Again, if you are into personal development, you're probably very smart, you're probably very good looking, but you also probably have a tendency to beat yourself up about things that haven't quite gone to plan or that haven't quite gone perfectly. But if the rule for the exercise is that the what's working category must have at least twice as many items in it as the what's not working category, it forces type A people like us to actually find gratitude in the things that we do already have. Because, let's be honest, you know, we all want to change our life in the next 90 days and stuff. But you know, things are going pretty well. You're probably in pretty reasonable physical health. Your mental health is probably pretty reasonable. It could be a lot worse. Sure, your finances maybe aren't quite in the place where you'd want them to be, but you probably have a roof over your head. You're probably watching this on some sort of fancy device, you've probably got an Internet connection, Your friends and family are probably, for the most part, reasonably healthy. Yes, of course we want to grow, but we want to grow from a place of satisfaction with where we currently are at. If we grow from a place of dissatisfaction with where we're currently at that. Actually, you know, I guarantee when your lot in life improves, you will still feel that, that, that dissatisfaction. There's a guy called Brendan Burchard who's a mentor of mine and he has a phrase, strive satisfied. I just love that idea. Strive satisfied. It's okay to strive for more, but we really want to be trying to be satisfied and grateful for where we already are at now. Another very productive way to spend your time is learning. And one of my favorite online learning platforms is skillshare, who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you have been living under a rock and you haven't yet heard, skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives with thousands of classes led by industry pros across film, illustration, design, freelance productivity and more. And I've personally been teaching on Skillshare since 2019. So I've got over 10 classes on Skillshare myself. I've got three that are specifically about productivity and a few more about how to use notion, how to learn Final Cut Pro for video editing, how to start a YouTube channel. And one of my favorite things about Skillshare is that they've got these seasonal updates. For example, in December, the theme of the month was reflection. And if you've been following me for a while, you know how much I love journaling prompts to reflect. And so that was like the theme that skillshare had for that month. And this month their theme is Creativity as a practice. Skillshare can also help you level up in your career with loads of classes around marketing, social media, ui, ux, being a freelancer, and some side hustle ideas as well. So overall you can learn a bunch of personal and professional skills on skillshare. If you are interested in checking out any of these classes or anything skillshare has to offer, including any of my classes, then check out the link in the video description and the first 500 people to use that link will get one month free trial to Skillshare. So thank you so much Skillshare for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. So we've just done step one, which is to reflect on where our life is currently at, and now let's move on to step two. And step two is to align yourself with a compelling vision for your future. It's very difficult to make any kind of changes to our life if we don't have a compelling vision for where we actually want to go. This doesn't have to be exact, you don't have to know exactly where you want to go. But we do need to have some sort of direction to aim in. Because if the vision, if the future that we're working towards is not actually better than where we're at now, there is. There's no, like, there's no motivation, there's no momentum to actually make any kind of changes to our life. My personal favorite way to create a compelling vision for the future is what I call the three year sketch, which is basically, you imagine today's date three years from now, and then you just generally write down. I like doing it in a physical journal for various reasons. What does life look like today three years from now? If things go according to plan or if things go well, three years from now, where will you be living? What kind of house are you going to be living in? Who are the sorts of people that you have around you? How's your physical health, mental health, emotional health? How meaningful and fulfilling does what you're doing for work actually feel to you? How much spare time do you have to work on passions and hobbies and stuff? Now this is something that takes a little bit of time in my quarterly alignment workshops and annual planning workshops, which I do completely free online. So if you, if you want to join those, you can sign up to my email list and I'll let you know when the next one is. But in those workshops, we do this as like a almost like half an hour visualization. Y you close your eyes and you imagine different futures and stuff. That's generally quite a nice way of doing it because you're sitting down to actually do the exercise and other people, at least on zoom or maybe around you, are also doing the thing. But of course, if you're watching this video, this is the sort of thing you can also do solo. So if you're sitting at your desk or something, I'd suggest if you really want to make the most of this exercise, maybe go for a walk, maybe listen to some nice music. Generally instrumental is better than lyrics and really just try and visualize your absolute best life three years from now. Don't worry about how you're going to get there. Don't allow limiting beliefs and stuff to hold you back. Like, oh, it's not realistic, it's not possible, it's not practical. We don't need to worry about any of that stuff. We just literally want to imagine that visualization. Imagine that dream life three years from now. This is what paints that compelling picture of the future that we want to work towards. And that description should feel exciting. If you look at that description, you should Be like, yeah, that would be pretty fricking sick if I could get there in the next three years. That excitement, that feeling of excitement is what's going to generate the motivation to actually do the things it takes to change your life in the next 90 days. Now I've been doing this for the last several years and I've always just had a three year sketch written out in terms of like what I want either on the computer or on Notion or in my journal. But actually last week my wife Izz hosted a vision boarding workshop for our productivity annual planning event. And for the first time, by following along in that workshop, I actually created my own vision board. And I have my vision board. This is currently what V1 of my vision board looks like. And this only took me about 10, 15 minutes to put together. But actually looking at it now feels, just feels really good. I'm like, oh yeah, I'd love to work towards this sort of thing. So I've got this like jacked dude who's like very flexible because I want to get into martial arts and improve my flexibility and mobility. You know, if my office could look like this with a lot of greenery and a lot of books, that would be pretty cool. It'd be pretty cool to have a really sick house three years from now. This picture here is a co working space or some sort of office. I'd love to build some sort of office for me and my team that like has great vibes and stuff and we can all work in person. These are some random app screenshots that I got off of Pinterest and that feels pretty compelling because me and my team are working on building productivity software. We've released one called VoicePal already. I'll put a link down below if you want to check it out. And there's a couple of others that we're working on. Super focus and progress, pal. And then a couple of others. Three years from now it would be nice to have three kids. Probably not going to happen, but hey, you know, it's the directionality of vision. Why not? I want to get better at singing and guitar and songwriting, which is why there's a picture of John Mayer. This picture is sort of hosting dinners with friends, you know, the social vibes. This is two people doing acro yoga. My wife Izzy is super into yoga. I absolutely suck at like flexibility and so I'd love to be able to do acro yoga with her. I want to get really good at playing squash, this sort of stuff. And actually just seeing this vision board you know, thanks to the workshop that my wife hosted, I'm like, oh, this is so nice. This paints, it genuinely paints a compelling vision for the future that I want to get to. And so when you have one of these compelling future vision Y type things to actually work towards, everything becomes a lot easier in terms of the motivation and momentum to actually do the stuff it takes to change your life in 90 days. If you want to create your own vision board, there are dozens and dozens of YouTube tutorials about how to do so you can just do that. I'm into all this productivity stuff, and for the first time I've made a vision board and I'm like, oh, this is actually quite nice. So I actually would recommend doing this. And that brings us on to step three, which is to plan your two main quests. So there is a productivity strategy that I think is really, really, really helpful for changing your life in any capacity. And that is the concept of quarterly quests. This is basically where you set goals that you're going to accomplish in the next 12 weeks, in the next 90 days, in the next quarter. Hence the phrase quarterly quests. Now, why do I call them quests rather than goals or tasks or projects or objectives? Well, I call them quests because my whole philosophy, which I have spent ages researching in Feel Good Productivity, is that if we can find a way to make our work feel good, to approach our work with more of a sense of play rather than seriousness, then it makes us more productive. And it also gives us more energy to give to the other important areas of our life. Why, with all of this stuff, all of this, like, life improvement stuff, we also want to be careful not to take it too damn seriously. Because if we take it too seriously, if there's this heaviness and importance that we apply to the whole thing, it sucks the fun out of it, it sucks the joy out of it. It leads to burnout, leads to stress, and it actually means we're less likely to actually achieve it. Whereas there's so much evidence that if you can approach things in the spirit of play, in the spirit of fun, finding ways to enjoy it, even with something trivial like calling a 90 day goal a quarterly quest, just makes it feel a little bit more fun, makes it feel like you're on some sort of adventure. Now, the key thing here, and my personal recommendation, is category of work and the category of life. You're only allowed to have one main quest each. There are two mistakes that people make when it comes to this sort of stuff. From what I've seen mistake number one is never setting any goals to begin with. But you're not going to make that mistake because you are here still watching this part of the video. So well done actually for sitting through the rest of this video. That's very good. Most people would have clicked off because like TikTok or Instagram or some other video or some other distraction. So the fact that you're here says a lot about you, says that you can sit through a video that's like at least as long as this one is so well done for that. But the second mistake people make when they get into the whole goal setting thing is just simply setting too many goals. I suspect you are a multi passionate type of person. If you watch this channel, you're pro, you probably have lots of interests, right? Maybe you're interested in personal development, but you're also probably interested in things A, B, C, D, E, F, G. You probably want to do well in work, you want to do well in life, you want to have good friendships, you want to take care of your health. The problem with people like us who are multi passionate who have all these different passions is that it's very easy for us to set all of these different goals in all of these different categories and then never actually make any progress on any of them because we simply have too many goals. And so you can either make a small amount of progress in all of these different directions and not really get anywhere, or you can focus on one thing and make enormous amounts of progress in that particular area. And generally a life transformation in 90 days happens when you pick one thing and you just single mindedly focus on just that one thing. So that is your main quest. So in the category of work, what is the single most important goal or project you need to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your work main quest? Here are some other ways to think about the question what one thing, if accomplished, would move the needle the absolute most? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you most proud? Alternatively, what's the one thing that would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Alternatively, what is the one thing you've been postponing but know it would be transformative if you tackled it? Alternatively, you might think of if I spent the first two hours of my workday purely focused on X, it would have an enormous impact on my work in that world. What is X? Again, I would recommend please pause the video to actually think about it. Because if you pause the video to actually think about this, I can basically guarantee that this video will be the most productive thing that you will do with your time, like this year, by actually watching this video and doing the stuff. Because it's so easy, right? It's so easy for us to just watch productivity videos on the Internet and feel as if we're being productive. But like, you know, if we're not going to do the thing, it's like, what's the point of watching the content? It just becomes sort of mindless entertainment or like productivity pornography at that point, you know, we don't want that. We want to actually do the stuff anyway. Now, once you've got a bit of a sense of what you want your work main quest to be, I actually have a tweak that I would do to this. So I've got a recommended phrasing for how to phrase your work main quest, and this is how I would recommend you phrase it. My work main quest is to. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish in the next 90 days. Because to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have done A, B or C. And we want these to be objective, verifiable criteria that someone else can verify. Did we actually do those things? This feels really exciting and compelling for me because. And here we want to lean into the emotions of it, the emotions of what will actually drive us to do the work it takes to complete the quest. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to. Please feel free to pause the video at this point if you would like to screenshot this or write these down or anything like that. And I'm just about to give you an example of one of my own quarterly quests following this format. All right, so this is my personal example. My work main quest is to make Life OS an absolute banger. Life OS is my productivity course. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because once the course is finished, it becomes our main calling card in the productivity niche other than my book. To complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have launched and delivered cohort number three of the Life Course. Number two, I will have created the Life OS Field Manual with all concepts and tools. And number three, I will have filmed and released the evergreen version of the course. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I get to put all my productivity, knowledge and experience into one thing, package it up nicely, and hopefully turn it into future books and apps, etc. I'm very excited by the Prospect of people using the system to genuinely change their lives. This is where the emotional side of the thing comes into it. Because again, like, like I said, unless you feel expensive, excited to work on this one work main quest, it's just probably not going to happen. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to firstly schedule the first two hours of each workday to work on it until it's done. Number two, log my focus time spent working towards it. And number three, send daily progress updates to the team to hold me accountable. Now, there is a huge amount of magic in phrasing your quests in this way. Like, it does take some time to think about this, but the way I think about it is like changing. Like tweaking the destination that you're going towards actually makes a meaningful difference in where you end up and also the journey you take to get there. It's worth taking a little bit of time just to make sure we're actually going in the right direction, going towards a place we actually want to get to. Because the least productive and the most heartbreaking thing of all is when you spend so much time being productive, being efficient, getting to a destination, only to realize that it was the wrong destination to begin with. And if you just spent a little bit of time thinking about it up front, then maybe the destination could have been improved and you could have saved all that time and effort. Naturally, we don't want this to be a recipe for never doing anything because obviously you can never be fully certain about the course of action you want to take. But it's worth spending, I would say, half an hour, once a quarter to decide, you know, what's really the main thing I want to work towards this quarter. Now we're going to put a couple of more examples of work main quests on the screen. When these examples are on screen, feel free to pause the video if you want to have a closer look at what the example is. This example is for the work main quest of completing a book proposal. This is an example I would have used when I was working as a doctor to apply for core surgical training residency program. And here is an example of maybe your work main quest is actually starting a side hustle of a YouTube channel. This is what that might look like. These are just some random examples that are relevant to my own personal experience. But hopefully you can have a look at these examples and you can see, oh, okay, I see what Ali's doing with these examples that are relevant to him. Great. Let me figure out how I can Apply those sorts of examples to my own situation. And again, if you actually do this, if you actually take the time while watching this video to figure out what is going to be your work main quest for the next 90 days, and you phrase it out in that way and you think about it and you leave a comment down below, I can basically guarantee this is going to be the most productive video you've watched all year. Okay, so at this point we have a work main quest. We are now going to follow a somewhat similar method to have a life main quest. The questions are a little bit different, though. In life, what is the single most important goal or project for you to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your life main quest? Some other ways of thinking about this. What is the one thing that, if accomplished, would bring the most joy, fulfillment, or peace to your personal life? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you feel the most proud? Alternatively, what is the one change that would positively impact every other area of your life? Alternatively, what's the one thing you've been avoiding but know it would have a transformative effect on your relationships or happiness? Or alternatively, you might think if I dedicated one hour of each day purely focused on X, it would have a profound impact on my life. What is X in that context? So these are all of these different prompts. Feel free to pause the video at this point and have a think about it. And now, once you've got a bit of an idea of what your life main quest could be, this is my recommended phrasing for your life main quest. My life main quest is to this is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter. Because to complete the quest, I commit that by 31st March, 2025, I will have done A, B and C, which again, are objective, verifiable criteria. Just as a bit of a tangent here, sometimes I do these workshops and people are like, I commit that I will stop procrastinating. But like, stopping procrastinating is not objective, verifiable criteria, right? Like, you can fool yourself into thinking you stop procrastinating, but you're not actually going to do it. And you've probably been trying to stop procrastinating for like 20 years at this point, and you failed. So, like, we got to change something. Some objective, verifiable criteria in that case might be, I commit that every day I will log my focused minutes and I will get my focused minutes to 180 minutes focused every workday. 80% of the time that would be something that someone else could verify that they can be like, hey, where's your focus log if you don't know what a focus log is? I have done a whole three part series on how to focus better. I talk about it way more in there, but basically you're just tracking the amount of time you're spending focusing and that is completely needle moving for your ability to focus. That's how you turn something intangible, like I want to stop procrastinating into something that's a little bit more tangible, which makes it more likely that you'll actually achieve it. Okay, that was a bit of a tangent. Let's keep going. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because and finally to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to again feel free to pause to take a screenshot and actually we'll put this stuff in the video description down below as well so you don't have to like take notes. You can just like look at it in the video description. Now here's an example from my own personal life for my quarterly quest for the next 90 days, my life main quest is to build a martial arts habit into my life. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because I've been putting it off for years and it'll have a transformational effect on my health and hopefully my ability to defend myself and my family. If anyone starts on me to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have attended at least 12 classes, averaging one per week throughout the quarter. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I've been wanting to do martial arts stuff for ages and by making this quest happen I'll figure out which one I enjoy, where I enjoy doing it, and can get started on climbing this new mountain of adventure. To make sure I complete the quest, I am going to spend an hour tomorrow making a notion page with all nearby options. Ask my wife Izzy to hold me accountable to this. Thirdly, check in with myself each week as part of my weekly review to make sure I've got a class scheduled for the following week and four mention it in a YouTube video. So it would be pretty embarrassing if me as a self anointed productivity expert doesn't actually manage to do it. So that is my life main quest. I'm going to give you a couple of other examples as well. So this is an example from let's say fitness and this would be an example from the world of dating at this point if you've actually done the exercise, you might be thinking, oh, but, but I have other things I want to do and the other things that are not the one most important thing, I think of those as side quests. And I tell myself, for work and life I'm allowed to have two or three side quests. But the main quest is the one that absolutely has to be done. And the side quests are more of a nice to have. It's like I'm not going to beat myself up too much if I don't manage to do it. Like I'm not marshaling all my effort and focus towards those things. I am really focusing on my main quest. And then the side quests are like, you know, kind of whatevs. Now if you actually do these three steps, number one, reflect, number two, align, and number three, plan your main quest for work and life, I can pretty much guarantee that you will have set yourself up to actually make a transformational change to your life in the next 90 days. Of course, once you've set the goal, you actually have to achieve the goal. And if you're interested in that, I have a video over here which is five very simple evidence based things you can do to massively increase the odds that you're actually going to do the thing that you've just set out to do. So check out that video over there. Thank you so much for watching. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThis video presents a three-step method to transform one's life in 90 days: **Reflect** (assessing current satisfaction via tools like the Wheel of Life), **Align** (creating a compelling vision for the future using vision boards or three-year sketches), and **Plan** (setting focused quarterly quests for work and life). The host emphasizes gratitude, playfulness, and avoiding overcommitment, while promoting Skillshare as a learning resource.  \n\n---\n\n### Chapter Summaries:  \n\n**[00:00-00:30] This video discusses a simple three-step method that can transform your life**  \nThe video introduces a three-step framework (Reflect, Align, Plan) to achieve life transformation in 90 days. The host shares his experience using this method in workshops, claiming its impact if viewers take actionable steps.  \n\n**[00:30-04:04] Brendan Sturch recommends doing a mini life audit to improve your satisfaction**  \nThe \"Wheel of Life\" exercise evaluates satisfaction across nine categories (work: mission/money/growth; health: body/mind/heart; relationships: romantic/family/friends) and adds a 10th category, *joy*, to counterbalance over-fixation on growth. A journaling prompt splits \"work\" and \"life\" into \"what’s working\" (requiring twice as many entries as \"what’s not\") to cultivate gratitude. The host stresses striving from satisfaction, not dissatisfaction, citing Brendan Burchard’s \"strive satisfied\" philosophy.  \n\n**[04:04-05:12] Skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives**  \nA sponsored segment highlights Skillshare’s courses on creativity, productivity, and career skills. The host promotes his own classes (e.g., Notion, YouTube channel setup) and Skillshare’s seasonal themes (e.g., reflection, creativity). A free trial link is offered to the first 500 viewers.  \n\n**[05:12-09:24] Step one is to reflect on where your life is currently at**  \nExpands on reflection tools: the Wheel of Life helps visualize life balance, while journaling forces acknowledgment of positives. The host advises grounding growth in gratitude (e.g., health, stable relationships) to avoid toxic productivity.  \n\n**[09:24-11:59] There is a productivity strategy that I think is really helpful for changing your life**  \nIntroduces \"quarterly quests\"—90-day goals framed as playful \"quests\" to reduce burnout.

A template includes objective commitments (e.g., \"launch cohort three of Life OS\"), excitement drivers, and accountability steps. The host’s example prioritizes focused daily time and team updates.  \n\n**[16:04-16:56] Use these examples to help you figure out what your work main quest is**  \nExamples include completing a book proposal, applying for surgical residency, or starting a YouTube channel.

Why am I making a video on how to get rich? When I was working as a doctor and doing the YouTube and business stuff on the side, no one ever asked me, how do you get rich? They would always ask me, how do you manage your time? How do you, how do you be so productive? And all of this, all of this sort of stuff. But now like eight years into this journey, I've now built a multimillion dollar business. I have a team. I never have to work again a day in my life if I don't want to. Now when I give talks and when I do Q&As and when I do like events and stuff, people will come up to me and ask questions. And the questions are no longer about how do you manage your time and how do you be productive. The questions like 90% of them are basically, how do you get rich? It's framed in different ways. You know, what's your advice for getting a high paying job? What's your advice for having a side hustle that makes enough money for me to quit my job? What's your advice for, you know, how I can have a six figure lifestyle business doing what I love? And I want to talk about something that I don't think I've talked about on this channel before. Basically. Back in 2015, I was in my third year of medical school. It's a six year degree at Cambridge University. And after three years we have like a halfway graduation type thing. I was at this halfway graduation with the other medical students in my college. There were like 15 of us and sitting with our professors who'd gotten to know us over the last three years. And one of the questions in the yearbook that the medics were talking about was which of us is most likely to become a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which means you're no longer allowed to practice medicine because they've deemed you incompetent. They've struck you off the medical register. Big deal. And one of the professors who had known me for three years and had taught me said, oh, it's obviously Ali. And I was like, oh shit. At the time, I had not started this YouTube channel. This was 2015. I started the channel in 2017. At the time, I spent quite a lot of effort, like trying to, trying to be a good doctor, trying to sort of do my, you know, get the grades and, you know, whatever. And I got a first class degree in one of my exams. And then that year I sort of ranked in the Top two in the subject and like won a prize and stuff. I thought I was pretty dedicated to medical school stuff. And this professor who I really looked up to casually in the, in a dinner context, I was like, oh, you know, which of us is most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which is like a really bad thing. He just, he, he, he said it would be me. I'd be most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register. I didn't actually get struck off the medical register, thank goodness. I voluntarily took my name off of it when, when I, when I quit medicine to do full time business entrepreneurship type stuff. But that made me feel pretty bad. I was like, huh, like part of me was like, oh, he thinks I'm gonna be a millionaire. But the bigger part of me was like, holy. He thinks that my pursuit of money is gonna get me struck off the medical register. What? I think the only reason I got rich, or the main reason, not the only reason the main reason I got rich was because I had an unhealthy obsession with making money. An unhealthy obsession with making money. There's a thread on Reddit, there's like a junior doctors subreddit and someone like posted something, a few like last year like what do you think of Ali Abdaal? You know, and some comments on this thing were like, oh, you know, I like his productivity content and he helped me study for my exams. But there were a bunch of comments being like, you know, that dude is totally obsessed with money. He's just obsessed. He has an orgasm thinking about money. Dude is so obsessed with making money. And it's interesting because this is now like 10 years on. This is 10 years after that graduation dinner where my professor basically told me I was obsessed with making money. To now people on the Internet telling me I'm obsessed with making money. And honestly, it's true, it's true. During the era where my business grew from zero to five figures to six figures to seven figures and suddenly I was making more money than a doctor would earn in a lifetime in a year. In that era I was totally obsessed with making money. If you want to get rich, I kind of think you need to be obsessed with making money. I'm sorry, I think that's it. I know a lot of people who are rich now. You know, when you become rich, you start hanging out with other people who are very rich. I've been on business trips and stuff with people with net worths in the multi seven figures. That is up to $10 million. Like one to $10 million. I've hung out with people who are and have net worths in the 10 to $100 million. I interviewed a guy, he's now a friend of mine, actually. He wrote a book called Never Enough. His name's Andrew Wilkinson. He's a billionaire with a B, like, net worth of a thousand million dollars plus. I have gotten to know a lot of really rich people. I have not met a single one who was not unhealthily obsessed with the goal of making money, with the goal of getting rich, with the goal of building their business. Once they get rich, that is when they start thinking about work, life, balance. That's when they start doing side quests, right? You know, bro has completed the main storyline by getting rich and now bro is doing side quests. That's when they take up martial arts. That's when they take up video gaming. It's when they start writing books about, like, how to be more productive and how to, like, live your best life. And, you know, I know lots of people who got rich through the process of them getting rich. They were married and had kids and pretty much all of them felt as if they weren't present enough for their relationship and for their family. And then they get rich and then they realize, you know, there was a guy I was speaking to, he was like 42 or something. He was rich, way richer than I am, as I would estimate his net worth to be in the 10 to $100 million range. Ish. He. I was chatting to him about a year ago on a trip, and he said that his unhealthy obsession with growing his business meant that he missed the first, like 10 years of his kid's childhood because he was always working and was on the brink of divorce because he was always working. And it was just a stroke of luck that saved his marriage. And he became less obsessed with making money then and started to think about work, life, balance. This is a video on how to get rich. How do you get rich? By having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich to the point often that it sacrifices other areas of your life. In my case, I'm kind of lucky that my unhealthy obsession with getting rich, the thing that it sacrificed was my medical career. Thankfully, it didn't sacrifice it in the way that the medical career was taken away from me by force, by me getting struck off the medical register, but it basically sacrificed my medical career because my obsession, my unhealthy obsession with getting rich made me build Businesses and stuff. And I realized I enjoyed that more. And then I left the day job. That's actually very fortunate. If I'd gotten married and had kids and then developed an unhealthy obsession with getting rich or had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich and was growing my business and stuff to the point where I then got married and had kids, that unhealthy obsession with getting rich might well have caused me to look back on my time with regret, thinking, man, I missed my kid's childhood. As I was getting rich, I had in the back of my mind that, like, okay, this is fine, but really the important things in life are, like, health and relationships and stuff. And, like, I don't want to. I don't want to screw this up, you know? A really good book is How Will youl Measure youe Life by Clayton Christensen. A book like Designing youg Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. There's books like Sahil's the Five Types of Wealth, which talks about how financial wealth is only one type of wealth. I think I managed to avoid a lot of the really negative consequences of being unhealthily obsessed with making money, thankfully. But it's interesting that even though I managed to avoid those consequences, my professor 10 years ago thought I was obsessed with making money. Random people on the Internet now think I'm still obsessed with making money. Maybe it's true. Let's say you have a dream to become, like a professional athlete, right? You want to play football professionally, you want to play squash or tennis professionally. Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it? Yeah, pretty much. Like, if you look at the training regimens of people who make it professionally, like top 1% people in any sport, from the outside, it looks as if they have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. They're just obsessed with it. It's all they think about. They live and breathe the thing. Their entire life is focused around the thing. And they go for that thing. Timothy Chalamet, famous actor, talked about how he wants to be one of the greats. He wants to be a great actor. And I know we're in a subjective business, but the truth is I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight. It's kind of unusual. Like, you know, we've been in an era where aspiring to Greatness is like frowned upon. You kind of want to be humble about it. Like, oh, you know, I just stumbled into acting. I don't know how I got these roles. I didn't try very hard. Like being a try hard is considered, used to be considered a bad thing. But I think people like Timothy Chalamet are making it cool to be a tryhard. He's being a try hard. He wants to be one of the great actors. That means he probably has an unhealthy obsession with the craft of acting, which is how he's, he's getting there and also he's really good looking and stuff and also a great actor. But you don't get there without having an unhealthy obsession with the thing. Everyone who has a top 1% or above outcome in anything tends to have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. We don't look down upon it when it's an Olympic athlete or when it's a musician or when it's a concert violinist or when it's an actor or something. But when it comes to making money, there's something about that that we like to look down upon. If you want to get rich, you probably don't look down upon it, right? I mean, if you're watching this video, you probably wouldn't look down upon someone who has an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. But if you want to get rich and you're at this point in the video and you've sat through me talking about how I think the way to get rich is to have an unhealthy obsession with it, your friends and family will probably look down on you for having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. Especially if you are in a country like the UK and I've heard Canada similar to this. I think in the US they're a bit more chill about, you want to get rich, go for it. Like, you know that kind of rah rah helping like big. You up for wanting a big outcome in the UK and a lot of European countries and I've heard Canada is like this as well. It's more like, you want to get rich, bro, what's wrong with you? Like, you know, think about the finer things in life. Like money won't buy you happiness, it's not going to make you happy. Like, you know, why, why do you need to get rich? Like there's this whole like this thing, this idea that if you're trying to get rich that is somehow bad. And I don't know, maybe it Is. Maybe it is. But, like, again, I don't know anyone who's gotten rich without being unhealthily obsessed with it. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? By becoming unhealthily obsessed with getting rich. What does it look like to be unhealthily obsessed with getting rich? I was having a conversation with a friend. This is a friend who wants to be rich. She wouldn't say, I want to be rich, but what she would say is, oh, I'd love to have a lifestyle business that helps me make at least £10,000amonth so that I can retire my parents, so that I can work whenever I want, wherever I want, and do work I love with people I love. That basically translates to I want to be rich, right? You know, how many people have the money to be able to retire their parents, have a lifestyle business, work from wherever they want, whatever they want, making at least 10,000amonth in profit. Like, man, basically, she wants to be rich, right? And so we kind of had that bit of a conversation, and I was like, come on, man, you know, let's call a spade a spade. Is it fair to say that you want to be rich? She was like, yeah, I want to be rich. I was like, great, fantastic. You know, we're owning the fact that we want to be rich. She was saying that she's doing all these different things, but feels like she's stuck in one place because she's not actually becoming rich. And she's been watching the content and reading some of the books that I've been recommending and stuff, because, you know, she watches the channel occasionally, but she's still no richer than she was five years ago. She is still stuck in her job that she enjoys sometimes and doesn't enjoy something like, whatever. Still stuck in a job, not getting rich. And so we're kind of talking about this. You know, she is training for a marathon, and at the same time, she wants to create YouTube videos exploring her artistic side. And at the same time, she wants to document her life on Instagram because it gives her artistic fulfillment to do that. And at the same time, she wants to host events for friends because she's very sociable and enjoys hanging out with friends. And at the same time, you know, she really cares about her family, wants to spend a lot of time hanging out with the family and visiting her parents a lot, and, like, just has all these different things that she wants to do. And she also has a day job, for the record. So it's like you know, 40 to 50 hours of a week are taken up by the day job. I asked a simple question. I was like, okay, let's call her Jane. Okay, Jane, how many hours a week would you say you are devoting to the goal of getting rich? And she had never thought about this question before, like literally never. It's like for five years she'd had the goal of 10 years she'd had the goal of I want to get rich. Was worried, was wondering why she's not there yet, which is why she was talking to me about this, because it was a conversation about how to get rich, basically. And I asked, how many hours a week are you dedicating to the goal? And she was like, oh, damn. I mean, I've got my day job. And I was like, okay, come on, you know, let's be honest. The day job is probably unlikely to get you rich. The way you get rich from a day job is either you work in tech or you work in finance. Those are broadly the two fields where your day job can get you rich, tech and finance. Is there anything else? Pretty much just tech and finance, right? If you have a really high paying job in tech or a really high paying job in finance, you can get rich off that, right? Because you make way more money than you spend even if you're living in London. And if you're living in London, you're making 500 grand, you're only only spending 100 grand on like rent and food and drinks and shit, you've got 400 grand left, taxes, etc. Etc. Put it in an index fund S&P 500. Compounding by the time you're about 40, you'll be rich if you work in finance. Similarly, if you work in tech, this person Jane does not work in finance or tech. Therefore, being honest, she's unlikely to get rich off of her day job. So time spent working towards a day job broadly does not really count for the goal of trying to get rich. Basically, it transpired she was spending zero hours a week focused on the goal of getting rich. Let's say you're trying to become a professional athlete, let's say a professional football player. How many hours a week would you need to be dedicating to that goal of being a professional footballer? Like many, many, many hours a day, forever, for like a 10 year period. And yet my friend Jane had the goal of being rich, which is a 1% goal, and was putting zero effort towards the thing. And we realized at the end of the conversation that this is a big Part of why she feels sad a lot of the time that she's not getting to where she wants to be because she wants to be here. And the actions that she's taking are completely devoid, are completely decorrelated from like this, this thing that she wants. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? So we talked about kind of the hours per week that you're spending trying to get rich. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? I want to tell you a little story and I want to compare. In this little story, I'm going to take a snapshot of my life right now in 2025. I'm currently 30 years old. 3, 0. And I want to compare it with a snapshot of my life. Let's say five years ago. Yeah, five years ago it would have been 2020. That was when I was in the peak of my getting rich phase. 2020 was the year where I went from earning a hundred thousand a year on my YouTube business to like 1.2 million a year for my YouTube business for the regular. So 202020 was a massive year of growth. I want to talk about the idea of mental bandwidth and content. Content, content diet. So back in 2020, there were two types of content that I was consuming. Number one was fantasy fiction, audiobooks on my drive to and from work some of the time and while I was at the gym some of the time. That was maybe 10% of my content consumption. The other 90% of my content consumption was about getting rich. It wasn't explicitly about getting rich. Back in 2020, there wasn't that much content about it, but it was about business. It was about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to literally all of the podcasts about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to all of the podcasts about how to build a business and how to market a business. The Smart Passive Income podcast, the Online Marketing Made Easy podcast, Noah Kagan's podcast. I was reading all the books, listening to all the audiobooks about business, the E. Myth Revisited and Traction, and dozens and dozens of books and audiobooks about how to get rich. 90% of the stuff that I was consuming that I was listening to every single day at like two times and three times speed was content about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What that unhealthy obsession looks like is that in your discretionary time, in your spare time, the thing that you are thinking about the things, the thing that you're consuming content about the thing you're reading about the thing you're listening about, the things you are listening to, stuff about the thing you're watching videos on is on how to get rich. Going back to this friend, Jane, I also asked her, how much time do you spend watching or reading or listening to content that is specifically towards this goal of getting rich? And she said, well, I watched a lot of content about, like, content creation because I'm interested in that. I'm like, okay, but like, do you plan to get rich through content creation? And she was like, okay, probably not, right? She's doing the content creation thing as a hobby rather than as a vehicle to getting rich. And I was, okay, do you watch or listen or to read anything else about getting rich? And she was like, I sometimes watch some of your videos about finance and stuff, but other than that, not really. And so this is someone who has the goal of getting rich, which is like a 1% goal, because, you know, let's say rich is top 1%, however you want to define it, whatever. And she's putting zero hours a week towards the goal. Acting. Acting towards the goal of getting rich. And she's putting zero hours a week of consuming content towards the goal of getting rich. That is not what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like, unfortunately. Yeah. So back in 2020, when I was in the process of getting rich, when my income 10x'd, I was listening to some fantasy audiobooks, I was occasionally going to the gy, but literally all of the rest of my time, even while I was at work, in my day job, all of the rest of my time was focused on how do I do stuff towards building my business and therefore getting rich, or how do I learn stuff towards the goal of building my business and therefore getting rich. And my personal view is, I think that's what it takes. I think that's what it takes. It's so hard to get rich. It's not an easy thing. Social media will make you think it's an easy thing. Social media will make you think that you can, you know, get super rich. And while you're in the process of getting super rich, you can also have a balanced life, right? You can go to the gym, you can have your friends and family, you can go on the holidays, you can do the things, you can have so much fun. You can train for a marathon, you can do a hyrox, whatever the fuck a hyrux is. You can do all those things. In reality, those are the things that rich people do once they are already rich. They are not. The things that they did while they were on the way, while they were switching from day job earning 50 grand to business earning 500 grand, while they were growing the business from like, you know, 100k in revenue and no profit to a million in revenue and like lots of profit. Like generally, pretty much everyone I've spoken to who has been in that position has been unhealthily obsessed with the goal of getting rich or building a business or whatever the vehicle say words getting rich. They are unhealthy obsessed with that goal to the point that it has created imbalance in their life because they've been single mindedly pursuing that goal. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? You become unhealthily obsessed with goal. What else does an unhealthy obsession with a goal look like? So I talked about what my life was like back in 2020. I want to contrast that with what it's like in 2025. Let's have a look through my YouTube feed. A man's content feed can tell you a lot about what they value and what their priorities are. So let me show you what my YouTube feed looks like these days. Okay. A video from Alex O'Connor about philosophy. A community post from Leila Hormozi. A Gary's economics video about why growth is stupid. Okay. Oh, here we go. Simon Squibb. This is a video about how to get rich. I have one video about how to get rich. Method versus mythic. Sprocket monger. Lemonstock Lock and stock protection warrior pov. This is a video about World of Warcraft. This is not a video about getting rich. Shorts is this rogue genius? Another video about World of Warcraft. Why you can tax billionaires. This is a economics type thing. Another World of Warcraft thing. Oh, Alex Formosi video about getting rich. This new weapon modification is amazing. For speedruns in Horizon. Forbidden West. This is not a video about getting rich. This is a video about a video game. Hmm. Sahil Bloom quote. This is a video about how to get ripped, which is not about getting rich. This is a Dorover CEO episode about fear and anxiety. This is Rory Sutherland not about getting rich. I don't know what this is. This is another World of Warcraft video. Not a video about getting rich. This is an art video. Because I'm doing a side quest and learning how to draw. You know, bro is running side quests. I'm doing a side quest and I just completed Horizon Forbidden west on the PlayStation 5. I've gotten back into World of Warcraft, the War within season two on my character, which is a paladin where I'm trying to play Holy and Prot and retribution and stuff. I'm trying to learn how to draw. I'm running, running all these various different side quests. I'm taking Muay Thai lessons. I'm starting going to the gym very regularly. I'm taking squash lessons. Here's a book. This is one on how to get rich. I've read this book, by the way. It's a good book. This is music. Another side quest I'm running is trying to improve my guitar, piano and singing skills. Not a video about how to get rich. This is Lewis Howes and Jay Shetty, sort of a video about how to get rich, but not really. They're gonna talk about, like, feelings and stuff. World of Warcraft, Iman Ghazi video about how to get rich. So sell something. Video about how to get rich. Survive or thrive. I don't know what that means. Australian Grand Prix, Networking, storytelling. Not about rich. Not about getting rich. I worked out like David Goggins for a hundred days. Not about getting rich. My content feed these days reflects what my priorities are. If you were to look at that, what would you say are the things that Ali Abdel cares about according to his YouTube thing? According to his YouTube feed, he cares about World of Warcraft, cares about gaming on the horizon, Forbidden west cares, cares a little bit about making money. Because, you know, 20% of the videos are about how to get rich. Cares about becoming healthy. A handful of those videos were about, like, health and stuff. If you'd looked at this, like, two weeks ago, it was, like, filled with, like, baby gear recommendations. Cause I was on a fricking rabbit hole about, like, you know, we've got a baby on the way. And like, researching the absolute best crib, pram, stroller, car seat, this, that and the other. And so my entire YouTube feed was recommendations for, like, baby gear. If you compared this to my YouTube feed back in 2020, all you would have seen is content about how to get rich, content about how to build a business, content about how to manage a team, content about how to grow a YouTube channel, content about how to grow on social media, content about sales funnels and all of this sort of stuff. That's all you would have seen. This video is about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What does that look like? What it looks like is that your content diet is towards that unhealthy obsession with getting rich. The unfortunate truth is that the more different goals you're working towards, the more balanced your life is, the less likely you are to get rich. Maybe there are a handful of exceptions to this rule, but in general, the pattern I've seen through, I know, I know a hell of a lot of people who are rich. I've interviewed a lot of them on podcast, read a bunch of their books. None of basically 100% of them did not have much of a balanced life while they were in the process of getting rich. They started, they got rich first and then they got the balanced life second. I am not saying that this is what you should do. I am saying that if you have the goal of getting rich, any or, or becoming a professional athlete, or becoming a professional actor, or becoming a professional musician, anything where this is a goal that only 1% of people attain. Like, to be better than 99 of people requires you to be more dedicated than 99 of people generally requires you to work harder than 99 of people. People say, you know, work, but, but I can work smart. It's like, okay, but like everyone else is also trying to work smart. Like, also when you're a beginner at the thing, you don't know what working smart looks like. Like, when you're a beginner to the goal of getting rich, are you building business or whatever, you just have to work really hard. And in the process of working really hard, you will figure out, what does working smart look look like so that further down the line, you can now work smart. Right now I don't need to work that hard right now. My multi and deca millionaire friends don't need to work very hard. They still choose to anyway because they're kind of obsessed. Still, a lot of them are obsessed. But you know, the ones with families and like balance, they don't need to work very hard. Why? Because they have employees who do the hard work for them. They've got systems, they've got leverage, they've got personal brands, they've got books, they've got passive income assets. They don't need to work hard anymore. But all of them had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich while they were younger, when they were building it up. So if you're at this point in the video and you would like to get rich, it's really worth asking yourself, do you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Would your friends and family say that you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Does your content diet reflect an obsession with getting rich? Does the way you spend your time reflect an obsession with getting rich? If the answer is no, then you have two options. I think all of this is just my opinion. Whatever. I think you have two options here. Either you can decide to develop an unhealthy obsession. You can change your content diet. You can start consuming all the content about getting rich. You can start waking up two hours early before your day job, putting an effort towards building your business. You can start while you're at your day job, taking slightly longer lunch breaks and using, squeezing in half an hour of, like, work on your business here and there in the evenings. You can not go out with your friends every night or whatever thing. You can stop playing freaking video games. You can stop watching Netflix, stop watching random YouTube videos, even videos like this one and only. Ever work on your business while you're going on a walk, while you're doing the dishes. You can switch your content diet so that you are listening to audiobooks and podcasts and videos about getting rich. On weekends. You can be like, oh, weekends, incredible. I've got, like, 16 full hours on Saturday and 16 full hours on Sunday where I can literally just wake up, lock myself in a room, work for 16 straight hours on my business. That is what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like. That is often what it takes. Getting rich is not easy. That's option number one. If you decide that, hey, I want to get rich, I trust Ali's advice on this. I trust that he knows what he's talking about, sort of somewhat anecdotally, and I trust that, okay, I currently don't have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich, and I would like to develop one. Or you can decide. You know what? Actually, this. This isn't for me. I. If getting rich requires having an unhealthy obsession to the point where my life becomes imbalanced, if getting rich requires me to stop running my marathons and stop hanging out with friends and, like, work on the weekends and, like, wake up a bit earlier to work before work and, like, work during work, if getting rich requires my medical school professors to think I'm going to get struck off the medical register because, like, I'm so obsessed with getting rich, man, if that's what's required to get rich, I actually don't want to be rich. If that's the path you want to go down, man, I'm so glad you watched this video because this video might have saved you all of this angst that you've currently got from, like, you have a goal of getting rich, but you're not doing the thing, which is to have an unhealthy obsession in terms of action. And in terms of, like, learning towards getting rich, you could just decide to make the goal less ambitious on that front. I'm not putting a moral judgment on this. I'm not saying anyone should have a goal of getting rich. I'm not saying getting rich is a morally good thing or a morally bad thing. It's a morally neutral thing. In the same way, I'm not saying that being a professional football player is good or bad. It just. It just is what it is. If you have the goal of being a professional football player, it makes sense that you're either willing to put in the effort required to be a professional football player or not. But if you're not willing to put in the effort, you're not willing to pay the price that it takes to become a professional football player. Why set yourself the goal of becoming a professional football player? The more we have this gap, the gap between where we want, the gap between the thing that we want and the actions we're taking, this gap creates misery. Misery is created in the gap. If I have the goal of being a professional squash player, for example, I don't. But if I did, and I'm only training two hours a week, I'm like, bro, that's going to make me miserable because I'm never going to get to that goal by only 22 hours a week. Similarly, if you have the goal of getting rich and you're not willing to pay the price, which in my opinion is having an unhealthy obsession with it, to the point that the rest of your life becomes imbalanced if you're not willing to pay that price, either become willing to pay the price, that is, become unhealthily obsessed, or just don't have it as a goal. You know, various people in my team, for example, are totally chill not being rich. They do not have the goal of becoming financially free, financially independent. The ones that do often tend to go out and start their own business and then they make videos about why they left the Alibda team to start their own business and they've joined our team, got inspired and started to, and decided to run their own businesses. Cause they wanted to get rich, right? But there's a lot of people in my team who are like, you know what? I don't really wanna get rich. I just want a nice job that pays reasonably well, that gives me flexibility, that gives me fun, gives me autonomy, lets me learn, and lets me hang out with people that I like, and lets me travel the world while I'm doing it. That's actually the position of, like, half the people in my team. They're like, you know what? Actually, this is great. I love my job. I love my life. That's fantastic. They do not have the goal of getting rich. And therefore, the fact that they're not unhealthily obsessed with getting rich is fine. It's not causing any misery because there's. There's no misalignment. But there are various people I know, including Jane, for example, who has a job and has the goal of getting rich, which is there. And her actions are here. And she feels misery every day because she feels the pain of misalignment, the pain that her goals are misaligned with her actions. And whenever you're in a situation where what you want is misaligned with what you are doing, it creates misery. So either change what you're doing or change what you want. That's my honest advice. That's my hot take on how to get rich. And if you enjoyed that video, then you will absolutely love my weekly email newsletter. It's called Life Notes, and it's where I share whatever I'm learning, watching, listening to, and just notes that I'm generally taking away from my work and my life. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found this useful, and I'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThe video argues that achieving significant wealth typically requires an \"unhealthy obsession\" with money-making, often at the expense of work-life balance, relationships, or other priorities. Ali Abdaal shares his personal journey and observations of wealthy individuals, emphasizing that most successful people prioritize financial goals intensely during their wealth-building phase. He warns that misalignment between goals and actions leads to dissatisfaction, urging viewers to either commit fully to wealth-building or reevaluate their aspirations to avoid misery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Summaries:**  \n**[00:00-00:48] This is a video on how to get rich. When I was working as a doctor, no one ever asked me**  \nAli introduces the video by contrasting his early career as a doctor (where questions focused on productivity) with his current status as a multimillionaire entrepreneur. He notes that people now primarily ask him about wealth-building. He recounts a 2015 medical school incident where a professor predicted he’d become a millionaire but lose his medical license due to his money obsession, foreshadowing the video’s theme.  \n\n**[00:48-07:20] Ali Abdaal says he had an unhealthy obsession with making money**  \nAli admits he was unhealthily obsessed with money during his business growth phase, citing Reddit comments criticizing his fixation. He argues that most wealthy people (including billionaire Andrew Wilkinson) share this trait, often sacrificing relationships or family time. He acknowledges his luck in avoiding personal life fallout but warns viewers about potential regrets, referencing a friend who nearly divorced due to workaholism.  \n\n**[07:20-07:39] Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it professionally**  \nAli draws parallels between wealth-building and professional athletics, asserting that top performers in any field (e.g., actors like Timothée Chalamet) exhibit obsessive dedication. He critiques societal hypocrisy that praises obsession in arts/sports but frowns on it in finance, especially in cultures like the UK or Canada.  \n\n**[07:39-10:07] Timothy Chalamet talked about how he wants to be a great actor**  \nExpanding on the previous chapter, Ali highlights Timothée Chalamet’s public ambition to be a \"great actor\" as evidence of necessary obsession. He contrasts this with societal pressures to downplay ambition, arguing that \"try-hard\" attitudes are essential for exceptional success but stigmatized in financial contexts.  \n\n**[10:07-13:37] I was having a conversation with a friend who wants to be rich**  \nAli describes a conversation with \"Jane,\" a friend who claims to want wealth but spends no time on wealth-building activities. He critiques her divided focus (marathons, content creation, family) and explains that high-paying jobs outside tech/finance rarely lead to riches. He compares her lack of effort to the rigorous training of professional athletes.  \n\n**[13:37-14:18] What else does an unhealthy obsession look like?**  \nAli argues that obsession manifests in consuming content aligned with wealth-building. In 2020, 90% of his media intake (podcasts, books) focused on business growth. He contrasts this with Jane’s unrelated content habits, stressing that mental bandwidth must prioritize financial goals.  \n\n**[14:18-19:44] 90% of my content consumption in 2020 was about getting rich**  \nHe details his 2020 routine: listening to business podcasts (e.g., *Smart Passive Income*), reading books like *The E-Myth Revisited*, and sacrificing hobbies for work. He dismisses \"balanced life\" narratives during wealth-building phases, noting most rich friends achieved balance only after securing wealth.  \n\n**[19:44-25:34] Ali Abdaal's YouTube feed reflects what his priorities are**  \nAli analyzes his 2025 YouTube feed (gaming, philosophy, fitness) to show his shifted priorities post-wealth. He contrasts this with his 2020 feed (exclusively business content), illustrating how obsession evolves after financial success. He admits current \"side quests\" (art, gaming) are luxuries of already being rich.  \n\n**[25:34-28:03] Misaligned goals between what you want and what you are doing creates misery**  \nConcluding, Ali states that misaligned goals/actions cause unhappiness. He offers two choices: embrace obsession (adjust habits/content) or abandon the wealth goal. He frames financial ambition as morally neutral but stresses clarity to avoid regret, using his team members as examples of content non-wealth seekers.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Wealth-building often demands an \"unhealthy obsession\" that sidelines other life areas temporarily.  \n- Consistent focus (time, content consumption, habits) on financial goals is critical for success.  \n- Misalignment between aspirations and actions leads to dissatisfaction; reconciliation is essential.  \n- Societal judgment of financial ambition contrasts with acceptance of obsession in arts/sports.  \n- Post-wealth \"balance\" is common, but rarely achievable during the wealth-building phase.  \n\n**Tags:** wealth building, entrepreneurship, work-life balance, financial goals, obsession  \n\n**Insight/Outlook:**  \nThe pursuit of wealth forces a trade-off between short-term imbalance and long-term freedom, requiring individuals to consciously choose their priorities or risk enduring dissatisfaction from unaligned goals."}]}
