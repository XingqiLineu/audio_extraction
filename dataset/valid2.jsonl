Welcome back to the channel. In this video, I would like to talk about why you should consider starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. And if you happen to be new here. Hello, my name is Ali. I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur and author, and I've been making YouTube videos on this channel since 2017, talking about the strategies, the books, the ideas, the tools that can help us build a life we love. And for me, the decision that I personally took many years ago to start a YouTube channel was the single most life changing decision of my entire life. I started out in 2016 making random crappy YouTube music videos that no one watched. But through that process, I learned a little bit about what it takes to, to actually make a YouTube video. And then in 2017, when I saw a business opportunity, I was like, oh, I could make videos talking about helping people get into med school. And this could be interesting because it could drive sales to my course. That was when I really started taking YouTube seriously. And now I've been doing it consistently. Pretty much every good thing that's happened in my life since 2017, I can like directly boil down to my YouTube channel in one degree or another. And so in this video, I would like to share my top reasons as to why you should potentially consider starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. There are all sorts of reasons I could tell you. I could talk about all of the practical benefits. I could talk about the value of being able to speak on camera, which for the rest I think is very valuable. I could talk about the value of learning how to edit videos, which even though AI tools are increasingly going to be taking over video editing, if you have the skill yourself, you can then prompt AI tools or use them better. I could make the case that, hey, if you start a YouTube channel at the start, maybe no one watches, but if you stay consistent with it over time, maybe you'll grow, maybe you'll get famous, maybe you'll get rich and all that kind of stuff. But none of that is really the key point. The key reason, the one that trumps everything else, is because of the internal growth, the personal and emotional and spiritual growth you will go through as a result of starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. The thing is, starting a YouTube channel, what it really does on an internal level, is that you are taking your ego and you are putting it out outside of your body into the world where it could be attacked. And that is scary. Maybe scary isn't the word that comes to mind for you, but there's often interesting emotions that come up when we have the audacity to speak to a camera and stick that video on the Internet. There are emotions that come up when you simply just hit record on the camera with the intent to put it on the Internet. I could ask you right now, get out your phone and make your first YouTube video and just hit record on your phone, boom. And some emotions will come up. It's not the same as being on a zoom call. Like on a zoom call, someone asks you a question, you can just respond. If you're having a conversation in real life, someone asks you a question, you can just respond. But there's something about the format of speaking to a camera, knowing that it might get published, that feels confronting in some kind of way. And that is a very good thing. The whole thing around, like personal, emotional, spiritual growth involves putting ourselves into uncomfortable situations where we are able to confront the internal demons that guard the gates, as it were. When you have the audacity to start a YouTube channel even though no one is watching and you put your ego out there, you'll feel the fear, you'll feel that, you'll feel the judgment, you'll feel the fear of judgment. You'll be thinking, damn, why does my face look so weird? I couldn't have any of my friends possibly seeing this video because that would be embarrassing. What about my work colleagues? You know, I'm considered a reasonably competent person at work. But then if people see this shitty video of mine that's like out there on the Internet, like, oh my God, like all of these things is a function of taking our ego, putting it out there in a basic ass form like making a friggin YouTube video and sticking on the Internet. And it's so valuable, it's so valuable to confront those feelings. It's so valuable to understand that they exist and to try and figure out where they're coming from and try and do something about them. Because really a huge part of like personal and emotional and spiritual growth is recognizing that A, no one actually cares. B if they do, it shouldn't really affect you. C, how the hell do you not care about what other people around you think? How do you like do your own thing? And basically what all of personal and spiritual growth eventually ends up in is being a being able to transcend the ego, being able to do something without the fear of this shell of an identity that we've crafted around ourselves being battered proverbially because someone on the Internet left a comment saying that your nose is too big or that you've got a zit on there or like, or you know, I don't like your accent or you speak too fast or like you're ugly or like oh my God. Like We've had various people take my course, the part time YouTuber Academy link down below if you want to check it out. We've had several thousand people take that course and lots of them have made only a handful of videos. And one thing a lot of people say is that even though they didn't make it as a YouTuber, which was probably normally the initial goal when they start something like this, even though they didn't make it as a YouTuber, they are still really glad about the growth that they had on that journey of even just making a few videos. And by the way, if you do happen to start a YouTube channel and you are interested in some six background music for your videos, then you'll want to check out Epidemic Sound who are very kindly sponsoring this video. I've been using Epidemic Sound for every single one of my YouTube videos since 2017, since I first started taking videos seriously. I started using Epidemic because they were recommended by Peter McKinnon, who was a big inspiration behind the channel and still is. Epidemic Sound has a massive library of over 50,000 songs and 200,000 sound effects, and all of these are restriction free, so you can use them across any of your projects, including YouTube videos, without any copyright issues. But today I want to talk about something really exciting that they've just launched called Voices, which is going to be super interesting for anyone creating content, including you. So with Voices by Epidemic Sound, you can easily craft the perfect voiceover for your content using professional voice artists. You can also create the perfect voiceover using your own voice, so no rerecording necessary. And this is perfect for your narration or podcasts or ad reads or adding segments to your video if you don't want it to be your voice on certain segments of the video. For artistic reasons, you can even modify the speed of the voiceover to match your storytelling needs and to help your content stay consistent. Even if you don't want to rerecord stuff, there's no need to rerecord, which is a key benefit related to the capability of recording and using your own voice. Voices is powered by AI, so you can fine tune the pacing and the language to match any style, which gives you full creative control. The best part is that Voices is already included in your subscription for both trial and paying commercial plan users with a set of credits provided each month. It's available both online and seamlessly within the Epidemic Sound plugins for Adobe and DaVinci Resolve. So it fits right into your workflow on demand, anytime, anywhere. So if you want to bring your videos to life with professional sound and now professional voiceovers, check out Epidemic Sound sound using the link below. And when you sign up for a free trial, you will get access to everything, including the new Voices feature. So thank you so much, Epidemic Sound for being our source of background music for the last eight years and also for sponsoring this video. And let's get back to it. So one aspect of this is this whole, like, internal confronting of the ego, where you try and stop caring about what other people think. Another big part of it is that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, especially if you've never done this sort of video thing before, helps you feel more of a sense of personal agency. It helps you get more of that feeling of you can actually take something random, like the art of making videos, and you can figure it out. To quote the title of Marie Folio's wonderful book, Everything is Figureoutable. And the thing is, when we start off as kids, we all have this belief that everything is figureoutable. Like, kids don't usually have fear. You'll see kids running around and, like, doing all the stuff and jumping off of things and et cetera, et cetera. But usually at some point as we grow older, we start to internalize the belief that we cannot figure out new things, we cannot learn new things. For some people, tragically, it happens in childhood where, like, a parent or a caregiver or a teacher tells you that you suck in there and you've internalized that for your whole life and then believe you can't do anything. This is how you end up with a fixed mindset rather than a growth mindset. For some people, that happens in school or in university or whatever when they realize that, like, oh, you know, a teacher said you're bad at math or bad at languages, and you start internalizing that thing. For a lot of us, it actually happens when we're doing our jobs because, you know, we got through school, got through university, started doing jobs, and then we became quite specialized at doing the thing. And we never really tried to branch out of the thing. Main thing that we're doing for work because, like, life gets in the way and stuff. And so when it comes to thinking like, oh, let me start a new hobby, like learning the guitar, every year, all these people decide they want to take up a musical instrument almost no one sticks through with it because they don't enjoy the experience of being really, really, really bad at something. Your ego starts to feel a bit threatened that, like, no, we're so competent in our job as an accountant, and so we don't want to suck at playing the guitar. We don't want to suck on this YouTube thing. We don't. We don't want to be bad at anything. And you can't learn new things without being okay with being bad at doing the thing initially. So why should you start a YouTube channel even if no one watches? It's because you will learn interesting skills in the process of that. But what is arguably even more important than the skills that you learn is the meta skill that you learn, which is the ability to learn new things. I remember back when I used to be a doctor working in the UK's National Health Service, and after about two years in my local hospital where I was working, a lot of the senior doctors knew that I had this YouTube channel and I had this business. And then, I think around then was when I made a video talking about how much money I made as a doctor versus a YouTuber. And then that video seemed to go around. So then, like, I kind of became known as, you know, this. This random, like, junior doctor who's like 26, who walks around in blue scrubs with bright orange trainers and whatever, this guy is making bank on the Internet. And I had a lot of senior doctors come up to me, really, like, encouraging me to do the thing. And it would emerge from pretty much all of these conversations that a lot of these senior doctors, they felt like they couldn't learn new things. They felt like they were so specialized within medicine that had all this sunk cost of medical school and then, like, years, if not decades worth of training that even though their heart might not necessarily have been in the thing, what they said was, yeah, but I don't think I could do anything else. I'm not saying that if you're a doctor in your 40s or 50s, suddenly starting a YouTube channel is going to be the answer to all of your dreams and hopes and aspirations. Not what I'm saying at all. What I'm saying is that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, with whatever kind of professional background you have, will force you to learn new skills and will therefore teach your brain and your heart and your soul that you are someone who can learn new things. With our YouTuber Academy, for example, the average age of Our student is 36. We had a guy take the Course, his name is Azul. He's like in his 50s as like a financial planner for old people, basically. And he decided, you know what? I'm going to reinvent myself. I'm going to try something new. And he started making YouTube videos where he just walks around with his phone, talking to the phone and giving financial advice to old people. And his channel blew up after about 18 months of doing it. Initially, he didn't get any traction at all, but he kept on doing. He kept on making one or two videos a week, even switched to daily uploads at one point, because he realized he enjoyed the process and he enjoyed the process of learning the new skills along the way at whatever stage of life you're at. I personally feel that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, just will be a valuable use of your time. I'm not saying you have to make 100 videos. I'm not saying you have to make one video a week. I'm not saying that the goal is to become rich or to become famous or anything like that. What I'm saying is that just give it a go. If you're watching the video at this point, you know, chances are if you've never thought about starting a YouTube channel, you probably didn't even click on this video. It's not even relevant to you. But if you're watching the video at this point, I would ask you, what is holding you back? What I hope that this video can be for a handful of people, maybe ideally even more than a handful of people, is the nudge that you need the permission that you've been waiting for from someone else who allegedly seems to know what they're talking about because they've got like millions of subscribers or whatever. The nudge you've been waiting for to actually just make a bet on yourself, to trust that you can learn new things and you can give this a go, even if it goes nowhere, even if no one watches the stuff. You will still, I promise you will still learn valuable skills. You will still find it a useful activity to do for the emotional growth, the internal growth, the personal growth, the spiritual growth, for the meta growth of learning that you can learn new skills. Learning new things is a key part of how we keep our minds healthy. It's how we keep our spirit healthy. Because the spirit and soul, or whatever you want to call it, has these needs for, like, growth. And so starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, is a really nice source of growth. And then at this point, people are like, okay, but like, what would I make videos about? You can make videos about whatever you want. We have this thing, our seven video challenge, if you're interested in joining it. It's for complete beginners where we basically give you prompts for your first seven videos. It'll be linked down below. Lots of people have taken it. The idea is that, you know, you pay to join the challenge, but if you make seven videos in seven months, we give you a whole seven months to make the seven videos. We will refund every penny you've paid. So basically it serves as an accountability mechanism which gives you a few easy prompts that you can make videos about. But even if you don't want to take the challenge, what's a video you can make? Well, a video you can make is why I started a YouTube channel at the age of X or whatever. Why I started a YouTube channel as an accountant, why I started even just why I started a YouTube channel. Another video you could make. Five lessons I learned in the last five years. Another thing you can make, advice I would give to my 21 year old self. Depending on how old you are, obviously if you, you know, whatever. In fact, if you do decide to make that video, I would love it if you can link it down below in the comments. Because I would love to have a look at some of these and see what the vibe is. But we don't want to be overthinking the stuff. We don't want to be trying to approach it like a, you know, a business planner being like, okay, my goal is to get a million subscribers. You know, the goal is simply to try it out. The goal is to do the thing. Starting a YouTube channel for a lot of people is a means to an end. It's like, hey, if I make YouTube videos, then I'll get subscribers and sponsors and money and I'll be able to live a life. It becomes like an instrumental goal, a means to an end for me. When I started YouTube, my first few videos I make, I think, I think were in like 2016. And I'm really glad it didn't start off as a money making scheme. Since 2010, I wanted to be a YouTuber because I wanted to make music videos. I loved people like Kurt Schneider and Sam Tuohy and still do. And I was like, I'm gonna make music videos with my friends because my friends are good at singing and I can, I can learn how to play musical instruments because that'll be fun. And I'd learn new skills and stuff and like, this would be Cool. And so for 76 years, I procrastinated every summer holiday. I was like, I was saying to my friend Dranka, right, this is the summer we're gonna make that music video. Finally. You know, it's gonna happen, we're gonna do it. And in 2016, I decided to make some of these music videos. They are still active on the channel. The goal was never to try and get rich or famous. It was just like it would be cool to be a YouTuber. And then I made a handful of these music videos. And then I realized no one watches, but I learned the skills of how to make videos. I learned how to use a camera and I learned how to edit. Then mid 2017, when I have the idea that like I can use YouTube as a lead generation device for my business that was helping kids, kids get into med school, suddenly I was like, oh, I already know how to make videos because I dabbled with these shitty music videos back in the day. So why don't I use the skills that I learned in making videos and now apply it to this business opportunity? I did not start off thinking that there was a business opportunity at the time. There was none of this content out there about how to make it on YouTube, how to make money, etc, etc. I think one of the downsides of that content and I, I would blame myself partly in fairness, I do try and always say with any of my content for creators, don't try and make money from it, that that should not be the primary, the primary goal. There's all this stuff about how you can make Money as a YouTuber or as an influencer and stuff. And I think it gives people the wrong impression. It makes people think that the only reason to do it is for the money. But actually there are loads of people who like play the guitar for fun, who make YouTube videos for fun. Because the art of creative expression and creative pursuit and like putting yourself out there and like editing a thing, it's like, it's like an art project almost. What would it take for you to see it as a bit of a hobby, as a bit of an art project? And maybe if you find yourself enjoying it and you're like, you know what, I can see myself doing this for like 10 years and enjoying the process, then we can now start talking about like a business plan and the niche and like target audience and value proposition and all the stuff that we talk about in my course. But you don't need to start out like that. You don't need to start out with that sort of I'm approaching this like a businessman approach. In fact, I would recommend you not do that. I'd recommend that your first seven videos are purely for you. They're purely experimental to see if you like the art of making YouTube videos. It doesn't cost you anything to do those seven videos. You don't need gear. You can just use your phone. You probably have a phone. You have a device that you're watching this on. You can download Imovie for free. You can download DaVinci Resolve for free. Video editing software. You can download Capcut. I think it's free on your phone. It's like, you don't even need to edit the video. You could literally just film a video and upload it straight to YouTube, straight from the app. You don't even need to do long form video. You could even do YouTube shorts or Instagram Reels or TikTok. Just any of these social media type things that involve creating something, having the audacity to put yourself out there. Because like, creating a faceless video is like, it's fine, but it doesn't give you all the spiritual growth benefits that putting your face out there does, because that's really confronting. If you're like a random person who's never, ever, ever thought about starting a YouTube channel and you're still at this point in the video, what are you doing here? It's like, hopefully, maybe I've convinced you that would be interesting. But like, I'm hopefully speaking to you right now because you've been thinking about this and you haven't done it yet. And someone else, like, it's okay, just like, give it a go, treat it like a hobby. I treated it like a hobby initially. I had no idea that it could become like a multimillion dollar business many years down the line. And had I known that, had I known that the possibility was there, I might not even have started because I would have overthought even more than I already did for the six whole fricking years before I got started. I would have overthought it to the point that I wouldn't have ever taken action. So that is today's public service announcement. If you've been thinking of starting a YouTube channel, I would recommend you do it even if no one is watching. And I am rooting for you from afar, from here in Hong Kong. And I would love it if you can post a comment down below of like, you know, your link to your channel or link to your video or whatever. The thing is, if this video has inspired you to take any kind of action at all. And of course, if you would like to dive deeper on this stuff, feel free to check out my course, part time YouTuber Academy or our seven video challenge. If you're a complete beginner, those will be linked down below. And if you do in fact want a deeper dive on strategies for starting a YouTube channel, this is my ultimate beginner's guide to starting a YouTube channel that goes over my three level system. So you can check that out if you'd like. Anyway, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThe video advocates starting a YouTube channel even without an audience, emphasizing personal growth, skill development, and overcoming fear. Ali, a doctor-turned-YouTuber, shares his journey, highlighting how creating content fosters emotional resilience, reinforces the ability to learn new skills, and builds confidence. He argues that confronting ego, embracing discomfort, and treating YouTube as a creative hobby—rather than a monetization tool—lead to internal transformation and unexpected opportunities.  \n\nChapter Summaries:  \n**[00:00-00:49] Why you should consider starting a YouTube channel even if no one watches**  \nAli introduces himself as a former doctor turned full-time YouTuber and explains how starting his channel in 2017 transformed his life. He initially created low-effort music videos with no viewers but later pivoted to educational content, which became the foundation of his career. He stresses that the decision to start YouTube, despite initial failures, led to personal and professional growth, setting the stage for discussing its broader benefits.  \n\n**[00:49-06:05] Top reasons why you should start a YouTube channel even if no one watches**  \nAli dismisses superficial reasons like fame or money, focusing instead on confronting fear and ego. Recording and publishing videos forces creators to face judgment, self-doubt, and vulnerability, which builds emotional resilience. He shares anecdotes from students in his course who gained confidence even without becoming full-time creators. A sponsored segment promotes Epidemic Sound’s new AI voiceover tool, Voices, as a resource for content creators.  \n\n**[06:05-12:26] Starting a YouTube channel helps you feel more of a sense of personal agency**  \nCreating content combats the \"fixed mindset\" by proving one can learn new skills (e.g., filming, editing). Ali argues that adults often avoid new challenges due to fear of incompetence, but YouTube forces them to embrace being a beginner. Examples include a 50-year-old financial planner who reinvented himself through YouTube. The process teaches the \"meta-skill\" of learning itself, fostering confidence and adaptability applicable beyond content creation.  \n\n**[12:26-15:45] Kong: I started making YouTube videos because I thought it would be cool**  \nAli recounts his own origin story: he started YouTube in 2016 as a hobby to make music videos, not for profit. This experimentation gave him foundational skills he later leveraged for business. He advises treating early videos as low-stakes \"art projects\" and recommends free tools like CapCut or DaVinci Resolve. His \"7 Video Challenge\" encourages beginners to experiment without pressure, emphasizing enjoyment over monetization.  \n\nKey Points:  \n- Starting a YouTube channel builds emotional resilience by confronting fear of judgment and ego.  \n- It fosters a growth mindset, proving adults can learn new skills and adapt beyond their comfort zones.  \n- Treating content creation as a hobby (not a business) reduces pressure and encourages creativity.  \n- Early experimentation with low-effort videos lays the groundwork for unexpected future opportunities.  \n\nTags: YouTube growth, personal development, content creation, mindset shift, creative expression  \n\nInsight/Outlook: Prioritizing personal growth and creative expression over metrics or monetization can unlock unforeseen confidence, skills, and opportunities, making YouTube a tool for self-discovery rather than just a platform for fame."}]}

So I recently spoke to a neuroscientist about how to reduce your stress levels. So this is endorphins. With endorphins, I'm basically going to give you an entirely different perspective on how humans should be managing stress. And stress is a huge topic. It's part of being a human. It has benefits and it has challenges. Like stress can actually help us to advance as a human and hyper focus our brain when we're under stress. And also if it's too chronic, the stress can be challenging. Now chronic stress is a huge problem. Apparently around a third of adults in the US are overwhelmed by stress on most days, which is kind of a big deal. But TJ Power is a neuroscientist who runs the Dose Lab, which specializes in understanding the four main brain chemicals that influence our day to day lives. Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins. And very excitingly, we are exploring each one of these in this four part video series. And in this last video, we're going to be looking at how endorphins work to reduce our stress. And then we're going to be talking about five actionable things we can do to increase the release of endorphins within our own systems. Part 1 the law of endorphins so in northern Tanzania, the Hadza tribe are one of the last remaining groups of hunter gatherers on the planet. And researchers have done lots of studies to find out what their daily life actually looks like and how it affects their health. Now what's actually quite surprising from this study in 2020 is that the Hadza tribe spend around 10 hours every single day not doing any physical activity. And this time spent sedentary is similar to that found in industrialized populations. But the key difference is that sedentary time in hunter gatherers is often spent in postures like squatting that lead to higher levels of muscle activity than chair sit. So they're basically doing what we call active rest. And the researchers of the study came up with this idea of the inactivity mismatch hypothesis. As humans, we evolved to engage our muscles all throughout the day, through both walking and running, to hunt and gather food and these forms of active rest. But now when we are relaxing, either we are sitting at our desk or lying on a couch or on a bed, and all of our muscles are totally relaxed, and this is where it's not good for us. Being completely sedentary for long periods of time apparently increases our risk of death. And diseases like heart disease and cancer. And it can build up lots of stress inside the bodies as well, which just adds to all of the other stresses we have going on in our lives. Now, if we think about how we evolved, there were just two main forms of stress, Hunger and danger. When you then look at how we would respond to those two experiences, one thing is in common that we'd have to do, which is physically exert our body pretty hard in order to get out of the stressful state. So we would have to fight an animal, we'd have to run away from another human, we'd have to deeply try and pursue finding food. But the one thing in common is our body had to physically work pretty hard. And when you look into this effectively, when our body is extreme, experiencing extreme physical exertion, in order to help us cope with the experience of that stress, it begins to release endorphins, which will calm our brain down. Endorphins are essentially our body's feel good hormones. There's about 20 different types of them in total, and they are released from the brain when we feel pain or stress. This then does two things. So A, it helps us cope with the pain or stress, and B, they also weirdly improve our mood. Beta endorphin was the first one of these to be discovered, and it's often linked to the idea of runner's high, which is where apparently people who are into running feel really good after they've gone out for a run. I've tried this. I never feel good after a run, but apparently you have to do it for a while before you start, like, really experiencing the endorphin release. And what's cool is that it turns out that beta endorphin is actually a much stronger pain reliever than morphine. And as you might know, one of the best ways to trigger the release of endorphins in general is to physically exert our bodies. And all of that gets us to the fundamental law of endorphins, which is move your body every day. Part two, five actions to increase endorphins. Action number one, walk runs. The law of endorphins is physically push your body every day. And this is interesting because, like, there's different approaches to, like, how much movement should we get, how many gym workouts, and so on. But if you have a fundamental principle that the body has to work hard every day in some form, that's a great goal. Okay, so we know from studies that the more intense your exercise is, the more endorphins you're going to release because your body enters a more stressed state. So something like high intensity interval training releases more of these feel good hormones than just walking or cycling casually. But that's not to say that you won't feel good after any form of exercise. And actually, actually moving your body pretty much always improves your mood afterwards. And that's why it's not that surprising to see that exercise is a great way to reduce depression. And this big study in the bmj, the British medical journal, found that the most effective forms of exercises were walking or jogging, yoga and strength training. Now, the most important takeaway from all of this stuff is that the key thing is to find a form of exercise that you actually enjoy and you can do consistently. If you're approaching exercise with a, I really should exercise that, you know this word should, it's going to create a lot of shame, it's going to create a lot of resistance. When we find a way to A, do the things that we enjoy and B, enjoy the things that we're doing, it becomes more sustainable, it becomes way more energizing. In my case, I really enjoy walking. I go on the walking track outside of my house. I put on my AirPods. I use an app called VoicePal, which is an app that me and my team have built, and I use that as a sort of AI ghostwriter. And I can kind of talk to the app and then the app will sort of ask me follow up questions and then that's how I get my writing done. That's how I script these YouTube videos, by the way, VoicePal is available on both iOS and Android, if you fancy checking it out, if for whatever reason, you would like to make your writing more fun as well. The other thing I really enjoy is racket sp of badminton, tennis and squash. And I find that starting the day or in the middle of the day or the end of the day or pretty much any time I play any of these racket sports, I feel so much better afterwards. I'm so much more energized. And even though it takes energy to play a game of squash or tennis or whatever, the energy that it generates is greater than the energy that it seems to use. And if you want to do some more intense exercise to really maximize the release of your endorphins, then TJ has a fun way of making your body work harder. And he calls it a walk run. And it's basically where you go out on a walk without your phone or headphones, and when you're out there, you try and Pick three moments in that walk where you're going to effectively artificially run away from a bear. So you're going to put your brain through that experience in that moment. If you have three moments, you're on a walk, 20 minute walk, three moments where you just go, oh my God, there's a bear behind me. And you just run as fast as you can. You're then going to every day be getting this activation of this chemical that's constantly de stressing your brain on hearing that you might be thinking, oh my goodness, people are going to think I'm weird if I go. If I'm walking and then I suddenly go for a sprint. What I would say is that's a good thing. It's generally good to do things where people think you're a bit weird because A, it helps you realize that no one actually cares and B, even if they do, it doesn't hurt you and not going to kill you. And I think that sort of don't give an F approach applied to a small thing like running and then walking actually bleeds into other areas of your life. Like if you're struggling to start a YouTube channel or you're struggling to do something a little bit risky because you're worried about what other people will think, doing these little micro habits, micro experiments where you're like not giving a toss about what other people think for a small, you know, a small, tiny sliver of time. I think that just boots boosts the general ability to stop caring what people think. Action number two, heat therapy. All right, so there is a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, and that essentially acts as our internal thermostat. The hypothalamus monitors our core body temperature and it sends signals to the rest of our body to increase or decrease our temperature so that it stays constant. At around 37 degrees Celsius, the hypothalamus communicates with the pituitary gland in our brain. And the reason I'm telling you all this is because when we get hot, the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland to release endorphins into our bloodstream. Anytime in which you put your body in a hot environment, your body experiences this thing called a heat stress response, where similar to running away from the bear, the physical pain that it would get from that, it actually perceives heat, like a sauna or a bath as a similar experience. It doesn't necessarily know that you're not going to stay in that sauna for hours. So it effectively Starts preparing itself for physical danger. As we've already seen with endorphins, they help us a cope with the heat as a form of stress and also increases our mood. But there's actually something even more interesting going on. So our endorphins have these two key effects on our bodies through binding to receptors called mu opioids. Opioid receptors. But we don't just feel better in the moment after heat exposure. It actually lasts for a long time afterwards because the heat increases the number of mu opioid receptors in our brain and bodies. So what this means is that the heat makes us more sensitive to endorphins, and this means that they have a much bigger effect and the effect lasts longer. So, for example, if there was something that you were kind of excited about, like, I don't know, playing World of Warcraft or going for a run or playing squash, if you have exposed your body to heat before doing the thing, then you should feel even better as a result of doing the thing because of this upregulation of mu opioid receptors. So the key takeaway here is to try and expose yourself to heat as often as you can to increase your core body temperature. How long should you spend trying to be hot? Well, it takes around 15 minutes for our body to release endorphins. And so saunas and hot baths or like jacuzzis or whatever are probably the best way to do this, because you would need to stand under a hot shower for a long time to get this effect. Action number three, the song habit. Singing does have a very euphoric effect on our brain. And coming back to the rule of physically pushing your body, if you really sing, it actually puts your body through physical. And you'll notice if you hum a song or if you really sing a song, you'll enjoy singing it much more. From a neuroscientific perspective, that's because the endorphins are releasing as a result of the body going through physical effort. It was really interesting, me hearing this, because I've been singing pretty much my whole life, and I actually often found that, like, when I would be procrastinating from making YouTube videos, or back in the day when I was studying for exams and stuff, and I'd be procrastinating from doing this thing that I had to do. I would often just, like, pick up my guitar or ukulele or set at the piano and just bang out some tunes and sing quite loudly. And if there were people around me, they would join in with the songs and stuff. And it would help me kind of ramp up and get into state to do whatever I wanted to do. I do this so often with my team around me that they actually created a meme for this. Then, yeah, singing just makes you feel way better. And if you're feeling self conscious about it, again, this is one of those things. No one cares. No one cares if you are singing, unless you're, like, doing it in a big corporate workplace. But you actually can just start singing, especially when you're at home, probably singing in the shower. Singing in the shower is great. You could also sing when you're at your desk. You could sing when you're going up and making a cup of coffee. And tj, our neuroscientist friend, recommends that we try and sing for at least five minutes, whether that's in the shower or in the car or when you're on a walk, because it definitely will make you feel a lot better. By the way, as you might have noticed, singing with a group of people or doing exercise with a group of people or working with a group of people makes whatever you're doing feel much better. And that is where the sponsor of this video comes in, which is actually me, because this video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab. If you're the sort of person who works from home a lot, maybe in your day job or maybe on your side Hustle or your book project or your memoir or your YouTube channel or what, and you find yourself sitting at the computer and then not actually doing the thing that you intended to do, then Productivity Lab is going to be absolutely perfect for you. Essentially, Productivity Lab is an online platform and community of entrepreneurs and creators and professionals. And we all get together and we work together through Focus Labs. We do reflective workshops each week where you reflect on how your week has gone and set goals and plan your next week. So it sort of serves as an accountability mechanism. And I like to think of it as like CrossFit or Peloton for Productivity. You're joining a Zoom Co working session with other people. I joined these for three hours each morning because I just get way more work done when I'm in a Focus Lab session, knowing that other people around me on screen virtually are also doing their work. And doing this stuff every day pretty much doubles my productivity. And we've had so many success stories from students in Productivity Lab who've said things like, hey, you know, I've been procrastinating on starting my YouTube channel for ages. And then I joined Focus Lab sessions, and now I'VE actually done it or things like, you know, I've spent five years planning to make this new iOS app that I've been planning to make, and then I never actually did it, but then I joined a few Focus Lab sessions and now I've built my minimum viable product. And so students in Productivity Lab are getting a lot of good results. There's a link down below. You can check out productivitylab.com and you can see if it's the sort of thing that might be right for you. And who knows, maybe I will see you in one of our coworking sessions, or in one of our reflection workshops, or in one of our planning sessions, or in one of our book clubs, or maybe in one of our in person meetups as well. Action number four, the habit of laughter. Okay, so this cool study in 2017 scanned the brains of a group of guys when they watched funny videos on YouTube in a room with two of their close friends. Friends. And what they found was that laughing increased the levels of endorphin in lots of different areas of the brain. So you can see the brain scans here and the hot colors show where there are more endorphins. And we know that these regions of the brain are involved in things like pain processing, reward pathways, and how we feel. So laughing is a really great way of triggering endorphin release, right? Even fake laughter eventually fake laughter because becomes real laughter. This is how I do thumbnails, by the way. When I'm doing thumbnails to these videos, my team will often think I'm really weird because I'll be like, and I put all these faces and other people can't help but start laughing. And it just generally increases the vibe and the mood of everyone around us. Now, the reason why we think that laughing has this effect is because when we laugh, we engage lots of different muscles in our body, like face and stomach and diaphragm. And because the law of endorphins is that physical movement causes endorphin release, the theory is that maybe because laughing is activating all these muscles, that is what is causing the endorphin release. The only question I like would guys sometimes ask himself is if you were to rate yourself on a scale from 1 to 10, how much laughter do you think you have in your life right now? If you answer that in your mind, you might discover that that score isn't 10. It might be more like 5 or 6. Of how much laughter we've seen over our training that we've averaged the number at 5.7 in terms of the amount of laughter people feel they're having. So whilst we know it's something we desire, it's something we're not necessarily getting enough of. So the way to find yourself laughing more, other than faking laughter is to put yourself in environments where you are more likely to laugh. Like, for example, you might call or FaceTime a friend if you're really lonely and you're in a new city, like I am right now. Or you might arrange to meet up with people more often. You could join a local comedy club, the Instagram Reels. You could train your algorithm so that it gives you funny stuff rather than sad stuff. You know, there's all sorts of ways to increase the amount of laughter in your life. All of them are going to feel good for our endorphins level, they're going to be good for our stress levels, they're going to be good for our life overall. Action number five. Up, down, twist. So this last action, action number five is very much aligned with the law of endorphins. Now, as we saw before, yoga is one of the best forms of exercise for reducing depression. And actually, according to this meta analysis, it is almost as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy. And this makes sense because yoga has a lot of benefits like reducing your cortisol levels and stress. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is altered with relaxation instead of the sympathetic fight or flight response nervous system. Yoga also promotes mindfulness. It also releases muscle tightness and increases the flexibility. And all of this helps trigger the release of endorphins. Yoga also has all sorts of spiritual benefits. I am just now starting to get into it because I'm doing a little bit of a spirituality era in my life. But yoga is probably not for everyone and some people do find it hard for various reasons. So the simple act of stretching is actually a good alternative. So I developed like a more simple practice which I call ups, downs and twists, which I do when I wake up in the morning and before I go to sleep. Upstand and twist is literally reach up as tall as you can, reach down to the floor and then twist your spine like this. Oh, feels good. Down. I really need to get better at touching my toes. I'm like, this is how far I go. And twist. I need one of these evidence based stretching routines. But you get the idea. Up, down, twist. And all you need to do is go through these movements twice a day, once in the morning and before you go to to bed. And this would be a very nice way to trigger endorphin release and to reduce your stress levels. And this stuff is actually evidence based, so you might as well. It's just free happiness points that we are otherwise leaving on the table. So that brings us to the end of the video. If you have not yet seen the other three videos in the series, there are going to be in a playlist over here, just underneath this Ravenclaw poster. And those are about the chemicals of dopamine and oxytocin and serotonin. Thank you so much for watching and I will hopefully see you in the next video. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThis video explores how to reduce stress by boosting endorphins, featuring insights from neuroscientist TJ Power. It discusses the evolutionary role of physical exertion in stress management and outlines five actionable strategies: daily movement (e.g., \"walk runs\"), heat therapy (e.g., saunas), singing, laughter, and yoga/stretching. The video also highlights the risks of chronic sedentary behavior, explains the neuroscience of endorphins, and promotes the sponsor, Productivity Lab, as a productivity tool.  \n\nChapter Summaries:  \n**[00:00-01:01] TJ Power spoke to me about how to reduce stress levels**  \nThe video introduces TJ Power, a neuroscientist studying dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. Chronic stress affects a third of U.S. adults, and this fourth installment of a series focuses on endorphins—hormones released during physical stress to reduce pain and improve mood. The \"law of endorphins\" emphasizes daily movement, referencing the Hadza tribe’s active rest (e.g., squatting) and contrasting it with modern sedentary habits. Beta-endorphins, linked to \"runner’s high,\" are highlighted as natural painkillers stronger than morphine.  \n\n**[01:01-06:30] Being completely sedentary for long periods of time apparently increases our risk of death**  \nStudies on Tanzania’s Hadza tribe reveal they spend 10 hours daily in active rest (e.g., squatting), unlike industrialized populations’ passive rest (e.g., sitting). Prolonged sedentariness increases mortality and disease risk. Evolutionarily, humans coped with stress (hunger/danger) through physical exertion, triggering endorphins. Modern lifestyles lack this exertion, worsening stress. The \"inactivity mismatch hypothesis\" argues that muscle engagement during rest is critical for health.  \n\n**[06:30-09:45] Action number two, heat therapy. Anytime your body is in a hot environment, it experiences stress**  \nHeat therapy (saunas, baths) triggers the hypothalamus to release endorphins via the pituitary gland. Heat stress mimics physical exertion, increasing mu opioid receptors, which heighten endorphin sensitivity long-term. A 15-minute heat exposure is optimal. Practical tips include saunas over showers and pairing heat with enjoyable activities (e.g., exercise) for amplified mood benefits.  \n\n**[09:45-11:14] This video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab**  \nThe host promotes Productivity Lab, a platform for virtual coworking, accountability, and productivity workshops. It’s likened to \"CrossFit for productivity,\" with users reporting success in completing projects (e.g., YouTube channels, apps). Features include Focus Labs (Zoom coworking), reflective workshops, and community events.  \n\n**[11:14-13:13] Action number four, the habit of laughter. The only question I like would guys sometimes ask himself is**  \nLaughter triggers endorphin release by activating facial, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles. Brain scans show laughter elevates endorphins in pain/reward regions. Fake laughter can become genuine, and environments like comedy clubs or funny social media boost laughter. The host shares personal anecdotes (e.g., thumbnail-making humor) and suggests self-assessing laughter frequency (average 5.7/10) to prioritize joy.  \n\n**[13:14-14:42] Yoga is one of the best forms of exercise for reducing depression**  \nYoga reduces depression nearly as effectively as cognitive behavioral therapy by lowering cortisol, activating the parasympathetic nervous system, and releasing endorphins. For those averse to yoga, the host recommends \"Up, Down, Twist\"—a simplified stretching routine (morning/night) involving reaching, bending, and spinal twists. Evidence supports stretching for endorphin release and stress reduction.  \n\n**[14:42-14:57] This is the fourth video in a series about dopamine and serotonin**  \nThe video concludes by directing viewers to prior episodes on dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin, linked in a playlist. The series examines brain chemicals influencing daily life, with endorphins as the final focus.  \n\nKey Points:  \n- Daily physical exertion (e.g., \"walk runs\") and heat therapy (saunas) boost endorphins, reducing stress.  \n- Laughter and singing activate muscles, triggering endorphin release and improving mood.  \n- Sedentary lifestyles increase health risks, while active rest (e.g., yoga, stretching) aligns with evolutionary needs.  \n\nTags: endorphins, stress reduction, neuroscience, productivity, mental health  \nInsight/Outlook: Integrating evolutionary practices (movement, heat exposure) with modern habits (laughter, community) offers a holistic approach to managing chronic stress."}]}

I've personally been using this method for years, and since last year I've been hosting free online workshops every few months going through the method. I've taken tens of thousands of people through it and people have gotten enormous value from these sorts of exercises. And if you actually do the things we're going to talk about in this video, then this might be the single most impactful video that you've watched this year. Anyway, in this video we are discussing the three step method, which is reflecting, align and plan. Let's dive into it. All right, so step one is to reflect on where you are currently at and do a bit of a mini life audit. Now I have various different ways of doing this, but I'm going to give you two of my favorites. The first one is an exercise called the Wheel of Life. And actually, if you want, you can do this exercise as you're watching along with this video. And the idea is that we are going to draw ourselves a little wheel and we're going to divide it into three categories for work, health and relationships. Now within those three categories, we're going to further subdivide them into another three categories. So within the category of work, we have mission, money and growth. Within health, we've got body, mind and heart. And then within relationships we've got romantic, family and friends. And now that we've got these nine categories, we want to ask ourselves the question that in each of these categories, how satisfied do I currently feel with where my life is at? And you give yourself a Little rating from 0 to 10 in each of these different categories. And it'll give you a bit of a visual representation of which areas of your life, by your own estimation are going well that you are very satisfied with and which areas have room for improvement. I find this personally to be a very good exercise to do whenever I'm feeling any kind of vague sense of unease about my life. Because then it puts actual, somewhat objective, well, subjective numbers on the thing. And then There is a 10th category that I like to add to the list, which is joy. And I would usually put that outside of the wheel because with all this like personal development stuff, if you watch this channel, you probably watch other personal improvement self development channels in it can be very easy to just be so fixated on growth that we forget to actually enjoy the present moment. And sometimes when I want to figure out how I'm Going to change my life in 90 days. It actually becomes less about. I want to improve personal developmentally in any of these particular areas. And it might just be. I actually want to experience more joy and so, you know, reminders to myself to enjoy the present moment and take a step back and to actually rest. Things like that. So the Wheel of life is one very quick and easy way to reflect on where your life is at right now. There is another one that I like. It's a very simple journaling prompt. And you know, you can take a page, you can do this in a physical journal if you want. I like these particular Harry Potter Moleskine journal book thingies. And you basically split the page into four parts. In the first column you have work. In the second column you have life. And then in the first row you have what's working and in the second row you have what's not working. And then you set a timer for five minutes, you put on some vibey background music, and you just sort of fill in a few bullet points in each of these different categories without overthinking it. Now, I have a little rule for myself whenever I do stuff like this, which is that the what's working category has to have at least twice as many things as the what's not working category. Again, if you are into personal development, you're probably very smart, you're probably very good looking, but you also probably have a tendency to beat yourself up about things that haven't quite gone to plan or that haven't quite gone perfectly. But if the rule for the exercise is that the what's working category must have at least twice as many items in it as the what's not working category, it forces type A people like us to actually find gratitude in the things that we do already have. Because, let's be honest, you know, we all want to change our life in the next 90 days and stuff. But you know, things are going pretty well. You're probably in pretty reasonable physical health. Your mental health is probably pretty reasonable. It could be a lot worse. Sure, your finances maybe aren't quite in the place where you'd want them to be, but you probably have a roof over your head. You're probably watching this on some sort of fancy device, you've probably got an Internet connection, Your friends and family are probably, for the most part, reasonably healthy. Yes, of course we want to grow, but we want to grow from a place of satisfaction with where we currently are at. If we grow from a place of dissatisfaction with where we're currently at that. Actually, you know, I guarantee when your lot in life improves, you will still feel that, that, that dissatisfaction. There's a guy called Brendan Burchard who's a mentor of mine and he has a phrase, strive satisfied. I just love that idea. Strive satisfied. It's okay to strive for more, but we really want to be trying to be satisfied and grateful for where we already are at now. Another very productive way to spend your time is learning. And one of my favorite online learning platforms is skillshare, who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you have been living under a rock and you haven't yet heard, skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives with thousands of classes led by industry pros across film, illustration, design, freelance productivity and more. And I've personally been teaching on Skillshare since 2019. So I've got over 10 classes on Skillshare myself. I've got three that are specifically about productivity and a few more about how to use notion, how to learn Final Cut Pro for video editing, how to start a YouTube channel. And one of my favorite things about Skillshare is that they've got these seasonal updates. For example, in December, the theme of the month was reflection. And if you've been following me for a while, you know how much I love journaling prompts to reflect. And so that was like the theme that skillshare had for that month. And this month their theme is Creativity as a practice. Skillshare can also help you level up in your career with loads of classes around marketing, social media, ui, ux, being a freelancer, and some side hustle ideas as well. So overall you can learn a bunch of personal and professional skills on skillshare. If you are interested in checking out any of these classes or anything skillshare has to offer, including any of my classes, then check out the link in the video description and the first 500 people to use that link will get one month free trial to Skillshare. So thank you so much Skillshare for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. So we've just done step one, which is to reflect on where our life is currently at, and now let's move on to step two. And step two is to align yourself with a compelling vision for your future. It's very difficult to make any kind of changes to our life if we don't have a compelling vision for where we actually want to go. This doesn't have to be exact, you don't have to know exactly where you want to go. But we do need to have some sort of direction to aim in. Because if the vision, if the future that we're working towards is not actually better than where we're at now, there is. There's no, like, there's no motivation, there's no momentum to actually make any kind of changes to our life. My personal favorite way to create a compelling vision for the future is what I call the three year sketch, which is basically, you imagine today's date three years from now, and then you just generally write down. I like doing it in a physical journal for various reasons. What does life look like today three years from now? If things go according to plan or if things go well, three years from now, where will you be living? What kind of house are you going to be living in? Who are the sorts of people that you have around you? How's your physical health, mental health, emotional health? How meaningful and fulfilling does what you're doing for work actually feel to you? How much spare time do you have to work on passions and hobbies and stuff? Now this is something that takes a little bit of time in my quarterly alignment workshops and annual planning workshops, which I do completely free online. So if you, if you want to join those, you can sign up to my email list and I'll let you know when the next one is. But in those workshops, we do this as like a almost like half an hour visualization. Y you close your eyes and you imagine different futures and stuff. That's generally quite a nice way of doing it because you're sitting down to actually do the exercise and other people, at least on zoom or maybe around you, are also doing the thing. But of course, if you're watching this video, this is the sort of thing you can also do solo. So if you're sitting at your desk or something, I'd suggest if you really want to make the most of this exercise, maybe go for a walk, maybe listen to some nice music. Generally instrumental is better than lyrics and really just try and visualize your absolute best life three years from now. Don't worry about how you're going to get there. Don't allow limiting beliefs and stuff to hold you back. Like, oh, it's not realistic, it's not possible, it's not practical. We don't need to worry about any of that stuff. We just literally want to imagine that visualization. Imagine that dream life three years from now. This is what paints that compelling picture of the future that we want to work towards. And that description should feel exciting. If you look at that description, you should Be like, yeah, that would be pretty fricking sick if I could get there in the next three years. That excitement, that feeling of excitement is what's going to generate the motivation to actually do the things it takes to change your life in the next 90 days. Now I've been doing this for the last several years and I've always just had a three year sketch written out in terms of like what I want either on the computer or on Notion or in my journal. But actually last week my wife Izz hosted a vision boarding workshop for our productivity annual planning event. And for the first time, by following along in that workshop, I actually created my own vision board. And I have my vision board. This is currently what V1 of my vision board looks like. And this only took me about 10, 15 minutes to put together. But actually looking at it now feels, just feels really good. I'm like, oh yeah, I'd love to work towards this sort of thing. So I've got this like jacked dude who's like very flexible because I want to get into martial arts and improve my flexibility and mobility. You know, if my office could look like this with a lot of greenery and a lot of books, that would be pretty cool. It'd be pretty cool to have a really sick house three years from now. This picture here is a co working space or some sort of office. I'd love to build some sort of office for me and my team that like has great vibes and stuff and we can all work in person. These are some random app screenshots that I got off of Pinterest and that feels pretty compelling because me and my team are working on building productivity software. We've released one called VoicePal already. I'll put a link down below if you want to check it out. And there's a couple of others that we're working on. Super focus and progress, pal. And then a couple of others. Three years from now it would be nice to have three kids. Probably not going to happen, but hey, you know, it's the directionality of vision. Why not? I want to get better at singing and guitar and songwriting, which is why there's a picture of John Mayer. This picture is sort of hosting dinners with friends, you know, the social vibes. This is two people doing acro yoga. My wife Izzy is super into yoga. I absolutely suck at like flexibility and so I'd love to be able to do acro yoga with her. I want to get really good at playing squash, this sort of stuff. And actually just seeing this vision board you know, thanks to the workshop that my wife hosted, I'm like, oh, this is so nice. This paints, it genuinely paints a compelling vision for the future that I want to get to. And so when you have one of these compelling future vision Y type things to actually work towards, everything becomes a lot easier in terms of the motivation and momentum to actually do the stuff it takes to change your life in 90 days. If you want to create your own vision board, there are dozens and dozens of YouTube tutorials about how to do so you can just do that. I'm into all this productivity stuff, and for the first time I've made a vision board and I'm like, oh, this is actually quite nice. So I actually would recommend doing this. And that brings us on to step three, which is to plan your two main quests. So there is a productivity strategy that I think is really, really, really helpful for changing your life in any capacity. And that is the concept of quarterly quests. This is basically where you set goals that you're going to accomplish in the next 12 weeks, in the next 90 days, in the next quarter. Hence the phrase quarterly quests. Now, why do I call them quests rather than goals or tasks or projects or objectives? Well, I call them quests because my whole philosophy, which I have spent ages researching in Feel Good Productivity, is that if we can find a way to make our work feel good, to approach our work with more of a sense of play rather than seriousness, then it makes us more productive. And it also gives us more energy to give to the other important areas of our life. Why, with all of this stuff, all of this, like, life improvement stuff, we also want to be careful not to take it too damn seriously. Because if we take it too seriously, if there's this heaviness and importance that we apply to the whole thing, it sucks the fun out of it, it sucks the joy out of it. It leads to burnout, leads to stress, and it actually means we're less likely to actually achieve it. Whereas there's so much evidence that if you can approach things in the spirit of play, in the spirit of fun, finding ways to enjoy it, even with something trivial like calling a 90 day goal a quarterly quest, just makes it feel a little bit more fun, makes it feel like you're on some sort of adventure. Now, the key thing here, and my personal recommendation, is category of work and the category of life. You're only allowed to have one main quest each. There are two mistakes that people make when it comes to this sort of stuff. From what I've seen mistake number one is never setting any goals to begin with. But you're not going to make that mistake because you are here still watching this part of the video. So well done actually for sitting through the rest of this video. That's very good. Most people would have clicked off because like TikTok or Instagram or some other video or some other distraction. So the fact that you're here says a lot about you, says that you can sit through a video that's like at least as long as this one is so well done for that. But the second mistake people make when they get into the whole goal setting thing is just simply setting too many goals. I suspect you are a multi passionate type of person. If you watch this channel, you're pro, you probably have lots of interests, right? Maybe you're interested in personal development, but you're also probably interested in things A, B, C, D, E, F, G. You probably want to do well in work, you want to do well in life, you want to have good friendships, you want to take care of your health. The problem with people like us who are multi passionate who have all these different passions is that it's very easy for us to set all of these different goals in all of these different categories and then never actually make any progress on any of them because we simply have too many goals. And so you can either make a small amount of progress in all of these different directions and not really get anywhere, or you can focus on one thing and make enormous amounts of progress in that particular area. And generally a life transformation in 90 days happens when you pick one thing and you just single mindedly focus on just that one thing. So that is your main quest. So in the category of work, what is the single most important goal or project you need to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your work main quest? Here are some other ways to think about the question what one thing, if accomplished, would move the needle the absolute most? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you most proud? Alternatively, what's the one thing that would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Alternatively, what is the one thing you've been postponing but know it would be transformative if you tackled it? Alternatively, you might think of if I spent the first two hours of my workday purely focused on X, it would have an enormous impact on my work in that world. What is X? Again, I would recommend please pause the video to actually think about it. Because if you pause the video to actually think about this, I can basically guarantee that this video will be the most productive thing that you will do with your time, like this year, by actually watching this video and doing the stuff. Because it's so easy, right? It's so easy for us to just watch productivity videos on the Internet and feel as if we're being productive. But like, you know, if we're not going to do the thing, it's like, what's the point of watching the content? It just becomes sort of mindless entertainment or like productivity pornography at that point, you know, we don't want that. We want to actually do the stuff anyway. Now, once you've got a bit of a sense of what you want your work main quest to be, I actually have a tweak that I would do to this. So I've got a recommended phrasing for how to phrase your work main quest, and this is how I would recommend you phrase it. My work main quest is to. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish in the next 90 days. Because to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have done A, B or C. And we want these to be objective, verifiable criteria that someone else can verify. Did we actually do those things? This feels really exciting and compelling for me because. And here we want to lean into the emotions of it, the emotions of what will actually drive us to do the work it takes to complete the quest. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to. Please feel free to pause the video at this point if you would like to screenshot this or write these down or anything like that. And I'm just about to give you an example of one of my own quarterly quests following this format. All right, so this is my personal example. My work main quest is to make Life OS an absolute banger. Life OS is my productivity course. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because once the course is finished, it becomes our main calling card in the productivity niche other than my book. To complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have launched and delivered cohort number three of the Life Course. Number two, I will have created the Life OS Field Manual with all concepts and tools. And number three, I will have filmed and released the evergreen version of the course. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I get to put all my productivity, knowledge and experience into one thing, package it up nicely, and hopefully turn it into future books and apps, etc. I'm very excited by the Prospect of people using the system to genuinely change their lives. This is where the emotional side of the thing comes into it. Because again, like, like I said, unless you feel expensive, excited to work on this one work main quest, it's just probably not going to happen. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to firstly schedule the first two hours of each workday to work on it until it's done. Number two, log my focus time spent working towards it. And number three, send daily progress updates to the team to hold me accountable. Now, there is a huge amount of magic in phrasing your quests in this way. Like, it does take some time to think about this, but the way I think about it is like changing. Like tweaking the destination that you're going towards actually makes a meaningful difference in where you end up and also the journey you take to get there. It's worth taking a little bit of time just to make sure we're actually going in the right direction, going towards a place we actually want to get to. Because the least productive and the most heartbreaking thing of all is when you spend so much time being productive, being efficient, getting to a destination, only to realize that it was the wrong destination to begin with. And if you just spent a little bit of time thinking about it up front, then maybe the destination could have been improved and you could have saved all that time and effort. Naturally, we don't want this to be a recipe for never doing anything because obviously you can never be fully certain about the course of action you want to take. But it's worth spending, I would say, half an hour, once a quarter to decide, you know, what's really the main thing I want to work towards this quarter. Now we're going to put a couple of more examples of work main quests on the screen. When these examples are on screen, feel free to pause the video if you want to have a closer look at what the example is. This example is for the work main quest of completing a book proposal. This is an example I would have used when I was working as a doctor to apply for core surgical training residency program. And here is an example of maybe your work main quest is actually starting a side hustle of a YouTube channel. This is what that might look like. These are just some random examples that are relevant to my own personal experience. But hopefully you can have a look at these examples and you can see, oh, okay, I see what Ali's doing with these examples that are relevant to him. Great. Let me figure out how I can Apply those sorts of examples to my own situation. And again, if you actually do this, if you actually take the time while watching this video to figure out what is going to be your work main quest for the next 90 days, and you phrase it out in that way and you think about it and you leave a comment down below, I can basically guarantee this is going to be the most productive video you've watched all year. Okay, so at this point we have a work main quest. We are now going to follow a somewhat similar method to have a life main quest. The questions are a little bit different, though. In life, what is the single most important goal or project for you to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your life main quest? Some other ways of thinking about this. What is the one thing that, if accomplished, would bring the most joy, fulfillment, or peace to your personal life? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you feel the most proud? Alternatively, what is the one change that would positively impact every other area of your life? Alternatively, what's the one thing you've been avoiding but know it would have a transformative effect on your relationships or happiness? Or alternatively, you might think if I dedicated one hour of each day purely focused on X, it would have a profound impact on my life. What is X in that context? So these are all of these different prompts. Feel free to pause the video at this point and have a think about it. And now, once you've got a bit of an idea of what your life main quest could be, this is my recommended phrasing for your life main quest. My life main quest is to this is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter. Because to complete the quest, I commit that by 31st March, 2025, I will have done A, B and C, which again, are objective, verifiable criteria. Just as a bit of a tangent here, sometimes I do these workshops and people are like, I commit that I will stop procrastinating. But like, stopping procrastinating is not objective, verifiable criteria, right? Like, you can fool yourself into thinking you stop procrastinating, but you're not actually going to do it. And you've probably been trying to stop procrastinating for like 20 years at this point, and you failed. So, like, we got to change something. Some objective, verifiable criteria in that case might be, I commit that every day I will log my focused minutes and I will get my focused minutes to 180 minutes focused every workday. 80% of the time that would be something that someone else could verify that they can be like, hey, where's your focus log if you don't know what a focus log is? I have done a whole three part series on how to focus better. I talk about it way more in there, but basically you're just tracking the amount of time you're spending focusing and that is completely needle moving for your ability to focus. That's how you turn something intangible, like I want to stop procrastinating into something that's a little bit more tangible, which makes it more likely that you'll actually achieve it. Okay, that was a bit of a tangent. Let's keep going. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because and finally to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to again feel free to pause to take a screenshot and actually we'll put this stuff in the video description down below as well so you don't have to like take notes. You can just like look at it in the video description. Now here's an example from my own personal life for my quarterly quest for the next 90 days, my life main quest is to build a martial arts habit into my life. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because I've been putting it off for years and it'll have a transformational effect on my health and hopefully my ability to defend myself and my family. If anyone starts on me to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have attended at least 12 classes, averaging one per week throughout the quarter. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I've been wanting to do martial arts stuff for ages and by making this quest happen I'll figure out which one I enjoy, where I enjoy doing it, and can get started on climbing this new mountain of adventure. To make sure I complete the quest, I am going to spend an hour tomorrow making a notion page with all nearby options. Ask my wife Izzy to hold me accountable to this. Thirdly, check in with myself each week as part of my weekly review to make sure I've got a class scheduled for the following week and four mention it in a YouTube video. So it would be pretty embarrassing if me as a self anointed productivity expert doesn't actually manage to do it. So that is my life main quest. I'm going to give you a couple of other examples as well. So this is an example from let's say fitness and this would be an example from the world of dating at this point if you've actually done the exercise, you might be thinking, oh, but, but I have other things I want to do and the other things that are not the one most important thing, I think of those as side quests. And I tell myself, for work and life I'm allowed to have two or three side quests. But the main quest is the one that absolutely has to be done. And the side quests are more of a nice to have. It's like I'm not going to beat myself up too much if I don't manage to do it. Like I'm not marshaling all my effort and focus towards those things. I am really focusing on my main quest. And then the side quests are like, you know, kind of whatevs. Now if you actually do these three steps, number one, reflect, number two, align, and number three, plan your main quest for work and life, I can pretty much guarantee that you will have set yourself up to actually make a transformational change to your life in the next 90 days. Of course, once you've set the goal, you actually have to achieve the goal. And if you're interested in that, I have a video over here which is five very simple evidence based things you can do to massively increase the odds that you're actually going to do the thing that you've just set out to do. So check out that video over there. Thank you so much for watching. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThis video presents a three-step method to transform one's life in 90 days: **Reflect** (assessing current satisfaction via tools like the Wheel of Life), **Align** (creating a compelling vision for the future using vision boards or three-year sketches), and **Plan** (setting focused quarterly quests for work and life). The host emphasizes gratitude, playfulness, and avoiding overcommitment, while promoting Skillshare as a learning resource.  \n\n---\n\n### Chapter Summaries:  \n\n**[00:00-00:30] This video discusses a simple three-step method that can transform your life**  \nThe video introduces a three-step framework (Reflect, Align, Plan) to achieve life transformation in 90 days. The host shares his experience using this method in workshops, claiming its impact if viewers take actionable steps.  \n\n**[00:30-04:04] Brendan Sturch recommends doing a mini life audit to improve your satisfaction**  \nThe \"Wheel of Life\" exercise evaluates satisfaction across nine categories (work: mission/money/growth; health: body/mind/heart; relationships: romantic/family/friends) and adds a 10th category, *joy*, to counterbalance over-fixation on growth. A journaling prompt splits \"work\" and \"life\" into \"what’s working\" (requiring twice as many entries as \"what’s not\") to cultivate gratitude. The host stresses striving from satisfaction, not dissatisfaction, citing Brendan Burchard’s \"strive satisfied\" philosophy.  \n\n**[04:04-05:12] Skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives**  \nA sponsored segment highlights Skillshare’s courses on creativity, productivity, and career skills. The host promotes his own classes (e.g., Notion, YouTube channel setup) and Skillshare’s seasonal themes (e.g., reflection, creativity). A free trial link is offered to the first 500 viewers.  \n\n**[05:12-09:24] Step one is to reflect on where your life is currently at**  \nExpands on reflection tools: the Wheel of Life helps visualize life balance, while journaling forces acknowledgment of positives. The host advises grounding growth in gratitude (e.g., health, stable relationships) to avoid toxic productivity.  \n\n**[09:24-11:59] There is a productivity strategy that I think is really helpful for changing your life**  \nIntroduces \"quarterly quests\"—90-day goals framed as playful \"quests\" to reduce burnout. The host shares his vision board (martial arts, productivity software, family goals) as a motivator and explains how a compelling vision fuels momentum.  \n\n**[12:00-16:04] What is your work main quest for the next three months**  \nWork main quests should be singular, emotionally compelling, and verifiable. A template includes objective commitments (e.g., \"launch cohort three of Life OS\"), excitement drivers, and accountability steps. The host’s example prioritizes focused daily time and team updates.  \n\n**[16:04-16:56] Use these examples to help you figure out what your work main quest is**  \nExamples include completing a book proposal, applying for surgical residency, or starting a YouTube channel. The host advises avoiding vague goals (e.g., \"stop procrastinating\") in favor of measurable actions (e.g., logging focused hours).  \n\n**[16:56-19:01] Use these questions to help you identify your life main quest**  \nLife quests focus on joy/fulfillment, such as fitness habits or dating goals. The host’s quest (attending 12 martial arts classes) includes accountability via Notion planning, spousal check-ins, and public commitment.  \n\n**[19:01-21:22] Plan your main quest for work and life for the next 90 days**  \nFinalizes the method: prioritize one work and one life quest, with optional side quests. The host warns against spreading focus too thin and links to a video on goal achievement strategies.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Points:  \n- Use the **Wheel of Life** and gratitude journaling to assess satisfaction and avoid toxic productivity.  \n- Create a **compelling vision** (e.g., vision boards, three-year sketches) to align actions with meaningful goals.  \n- Set **single quarterly quests** for work and life, emphasizing playfulness and verifiable outcomes.  \n- Avoid overcommitment; focus on 1–2 \"main quests\" to drive transformational progress.  \n\n**Tags:** productivity methods, life planning, goal setting, personal development, quarterly goals  \n\n**Insight/Outlook:** Combining structured self-assessment with playful, focused goal-setting can sustainably bridge the gap between current reality and aspirational futures."}]}

Why am I making a video on how to get rich? When I was working as a doctor and doing the YouTube and business stuff on the side, no one ever asked me, how do you get rich? They would always ask me, how do you manage your time? How do you, how do you be so productive? And all of this, all of this sort of stuff. But now like eight years into this journey, I've now built a multimillion dollar business. I have a team. I never have to work again a day in my life if I don't want to. Now when I give talks and when I do Q&As and when I do like events and stuff, people will come up to me and ask questions. And the questions are no longer about how do you manage your time and how do you be productive. The questions like 90% of them are basically, how do you get rich? It's framed in different ways. You know, what's your advice for getting a high paying job? What's your advice for having a side hustle that makes enough money for me to quit my job? What's your advice for, you know, how I can have a six figure lifestyle business doing what I love? And I want to talk about something that I don't think I've talked about on this channel before. Basically. Back in 2015, I was in my third year of medical school. It's a six year degree at Cambridge University. And after three years we have like a halfway graduation type thing. I was at this halfway graduation with the other medical students in my college. There were like 15 of us and sitting with our professors who'd gotten to know us over the last three years. And one of the questions in the yearbook that the medics were talking about was which of us is most likely to become a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which means you're no longer allowed to practice medicine because they've deemed you incompetent. They've struck you off the medical register. Big deal. And one of the professors who had known me for three years and had taught me said, oh, it's obviously Ali. And I was like, oh shit. At the time, I had not started this YouTube channel. This was 2015. I started the channel in 2017. At the time, I spent quite a lot of effort, like trying to, trying to be a good doctor, trying to sort of do my, you know, get the grades and, you know, whatever. And I got a first class degree in one of my exams. And then that year I sort of ranked in the Top two in the subject and like won a prize and stuff. I thought I was pretty dedicated to medical school stuff. And this professor who I really looked up to casually in the, in a dinner context, I was like, oh, you know, which of us is most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which is like a really bad thing. He just, he, he, he said it would be me. I'd be most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register. I didn't actually get struck off the medical register, thank goodness. I voluntarily took my name off of it when, when I, when I quit medicine to do full time business entrepreneurship type stuff. But that made me feel pretty bad. I was like, huh, like part of me was like, oh, he thinks I'm gonna be a millionaire. But the bigger part of me was like, holy. He thinks that my pursuit of money is gonna get me struck off the medical register. What? I think the only reason I got rich, or the main reason, not the only reason the main reason I got rich was because I had an unhealthy obsession with making money. An unhealthy obsession with making money. There's a thread on Reddit, there's like a junior doctors subreddit and someone like posted something, a few like last year like what do you think of Ali Abdaal? You know, and some comments on this thing were like, oh, you know, I like his productivity content and he helped me study for my exams. But there were a bunch of comments being like, you know, that dude is totally obsessed with money. He's just obsessed. He has an orgasm thinking about money. Dude is so obsessed with making money. And it's interesting because this is now like 10 years on. This is 10 years after that graduation dinner where my professor basically told me I was obsessed with making money. To now people on the Internet telling me I'm obsessed with making money. And honestly, it's true, it's true. During the era where my business grew from zero to five figures to six figures to seven figures and suddenly I was making more money than a doctor would earn in a lifetime in a year. In that era I was totally obsessed with making money. If you want to get rich, I kind of think you need to be obsessed with making money. I'm sorry, I think that's it. I know a lot of people who are rich now. You know, when you become rich, you start hanging out with other people who are very rich. I've been on business trips and stuff with people with net worths in the multi seven figures. That is up to $10 million. Like one to $10 million. I've hung out with people who are and have net worths in the 10 to $100 million. I interviewed a guy, he's now a friend of mine, actually. He wrote a book called Never Enough. His name's Andrew Wilkinson. He's a billionaire with a B, like, net worth of a thousand million dollars plus. I have gotten to know a lot of really rich people. I have not met a single one who was not unhealthily obsessed with the goal of making money, with the goal of getting rich, with the goal of building their business. Once they get rich, that is when they start thinking about work, life, balance. That's when they start doing side quests, right? You know, bro has completed the main storyline by getting rich and now bro is doing side quests. That's when they take up martial arts. That's when they take up video gaming. It's when they start writing books about, like, how to be more productive and how to, like, live your best life. And, you know, I know lots of people who got rich through the process of them getting rich. They were married and had kids and pretty much all of them felt as if they weren't present enough for their relationship and for their family. And then they get rich and then they realize, you know, there was a guy I was speaking to, he was like 42 or something. He was rich, way richer than I am, as I would estimate his net worth to be in the 10 to $100 million range. Ish. He. I was chatting to him about a year ago on a trip, and he said that his unhealthy obsession with growing his business meant that he missed the first, like 10 years of his kid's childhood because he was always working and was on the brink of divorce because he was always working. And it was just a stroke of luck that saved his marriage. And he became less obsessed with making money then and started to think about work, life, balance. This is a video on how to get rich. How do you get rich? By having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich to the point often that it sacrifices other areas of your life. In my case, I'm kind of lucky that my unhealthy obsession with getting rich, the thing that it sacrificed was my medical career. Thankfully, it didn't sacrifice it in the way that the medical career was taken away from me by force, by me getting struck off the medical register, but it basically sacrificed my medical career because my obsession, my unhealthy obsession with getting rich made me build Businesses and stuff. And I realized I enjoyed that more. And then I left the day job. That's actually very fortunate. If I'd gotten married and had kids and then developed an unhealthy obsession with getting rich or had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich and was growing my business and stuff to the point where I then got married and had kids, that unhealthy obsession with getting rich might well have caused me to look back on my time with regret, thinking, man, I missed my kid's childhood. As I was getting rich, I had in the back of my mind that, like, okay, this is fine, but really the important things in life are, like, health and relationships and stuff. And, like, I don't want to. I don't want to screw this up, you know? A really good book is How Will youl Measure youe Life by Clayton Christensen. A book like Designing youg Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. There's books like Sahil's the Five Types of Wealth, which talks about how financial wealth is only one type of wealth. I think I managed to avoid a lot of the really negative consequences of being unhealthily obsessed with making money, thankfully. But it's interesting that even though I managed to avoid those consequences, my professor 10 years ago thought I was obsessed with making money. Random people on the Internet now think I'm still obsessed with making money. Maybe it's true. Let's say you have a dream to become, like a professional athlete, right? You want to play football professionally, you want to play squash or tennis professionally. Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it? Yeah, pretty much. Like, if you look at the training regimens of people who make it professionally, like top 1% people in any sport, from the outside, it looks as if they have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. They're just obsessed with it. It's all they think about. They live and breathe the thing. Their entire life is focused around the thing. And they go for that thing. Timothy Chalamet, famous actor, talked about how he wants to be one of the greats. He wants to be a great actor. And I know we're in a subjective business, but the truth is I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight. It's kind of unusual. Like, you know, we've been in an era where aspiring to Greatness is like frowned upon. You kind of want to be humble about it. Like, oh, you know, I just stumbled into acting. I don't know how I got these roles. I didn't try very hard. Like being a try hard is considered, used to be considered a bad thing. But I think people like Timothy Chalamet are making it cool to be a tryhard. He's being a try hard. He wants to be one of the great actors. That means he probably has an unhealthy obsession with the craft of acting, which is how he's, he's getting there and also he's really good looking and stuff and also a great actor. But you don't get there without having an unhealthy obsession with the thing. Everyone who has a top 1% or above outcome in anything tends to have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. We don't look down upon it when it's an Olympic athlete or when it's a musician or when it's a concert violinist or when it's an actor or something. But when it comes to making money, there's something about that that we like to look down upon. If you want to get rich, you probably don't look down upon it, right? I mean, if you're watching this video, you probably wouldn't look down upon someone who has an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. But if you want to get rich and you're at this point in the video and you've sat through me talking about how I think the way to get rich is to have an unhealthy obsession with it, your friends and family will probably look down on you for having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. Especially if you are in a country like the UK and I've heard Canada similar to this. I think in the US they're a bit more chill about, you want to get rich, go for it. Like, you know that kind of rah rah helping like big. You up for wanting a big outcome in the UK and a lot of European countries and I've heard Canada is like this as well. It's more like, you want to get rich, bro, what's wrong with you? Like, you know, think about the finer things in life. Like money won't buy you happiness, it's not going to make you happy. Like, you know, why, why do you need to get rich? Like there's this whole like this thing, this idea that if you're trying to get rich that is somehow bad. And I don't know, maybe it Is. Maybe it is. But, like, again, I don't know anyone who's gotten rich without being unhealthily obsessed with it. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? By becoming unhealthily obsessed with getting rich. What does it look like to be unhealthily obsessed with getting rich? I was having a conversation with a friend. This is a friend who wants to be rich. She wouldn't say, I want to be rich, but what she would say is, oh, I'd love to have a lifestyle business that helps me make at least £10,000amonth so that I can retire my parents, so that I can work whenever I want, wherever I want, and do work I love with people I love. That basically translates to I want to be rich, right? You know, how many people have the money to be able to retire their parents, have a lifestyle business, work from wherever they want, whatever they want, making at least 10,000amonth in profit. Like, man, basically, she wants to be rich, right? And so we kind of had that bit of a conversation, and I was like, come on, man, you know, let's call a spade a spade. Is it fair to say that you want to be rich? She was like, yeah, I want to be rich. I was like, great, fantastic. You know, we're owning the fact that we want to be rich. She was saying that she's doing all these different things, but feels like she's stuck in one place because she's not actually becoming rich. And she's been watching the content and reading some of the books that I've been recommending and stuff, because, you know, she watches the channel occasionally, but she's still no richer than she was five years ago. She is still stuck in her job that she enjoys sometimes and doesn't enjoy something like, whatever. Still stuck in a job, not getting rich. And so we're kind of talking about this. You know, she is training for a marathon, and at the same time, she wants to create YouTube videos exploring her artistic side. And at the same time, she wants to document her life on Instagram because it gives her artistic fulfillment to do that. And at the same time, she wants to host events for friends because she's very sociable and enjoys hanging out with friends. And at the same time, you know, she really cares about her family, wants to spend a lot of time hanging out with the family and visiting her parents a lot, and, like, just has all these different things that she wants to do. And she also has a day job, for the record. So it's like you know, 40 to 50 hours of a week are taken up by the day job. I asked a simple question. I was like, okay, let's call her Jane. Okay, Jane, how many hours a week would you say you are devoting to the goal of getting rich? And she had never thought about this question before, like literally never. It's like for five years she'd had the goal of 10 years she'd had the goal of I want to get rich. Was worried, was wondering why she's not there yet, which is why she was talking to me about this, because it was a conversation about how to get rich, basically. And I asked, how many hours a week are you dedicating to the goal? And she was like, oh, damn. I mean, I've got my day job. And I was like, okay, come on, you know, let's be honest. The day job is probably unlikely to get you rich. The way you get rich from a day job is either you work in tech or you work in finance. Those are broadly the two fields where your day job can get you rich, tech and finance. Is there anything else? Pretty much just tech and finance, right? If you have a really high paying job in tech or a really high paying job in finance, you can get rich off that, right? Because you make way more money than you spend even if you're living in London. And if you're living in London, you're making 500 grand, you're only only spending 100 grand on like rent and food and drinks and shit, you've got 400 grand left, taxes, etc. Etc. Put it in an index fund S&P 500. Compounding by the time you're about 40, you'll be rich if you work in finance. Similarly, if you work in tech, this person Jane does not work in finance or tech. Therefore, being honest, she's unlikely to get rich off of her day job. So time spent working towards a day job broadly does not really count for the goal of trying to get rich. Basically, it transpired she was spending zero hours a week focused on the goal of getting rich. Let's say you're trying to become a professional athlete, let's say a professional football player. How many hours a week would you need to be dedicating to that goal of being a professional footballer? Like many, many, many hours a day, forever, for like a 10 year period. And yet my friend Jane had the goal of being rich, which is a 1% goal, and was putting zero effort towards the thing. And we realized at the end of the conversation that this is a big Part of why she feels sad a lot of the time that she's not getting to where she wants to be because she wants to be here. And the actions that she's taking are completely devoid, are completely decorrelated from like this, this thing that she wants. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? So we talked about kind of the hours per week that you're spending trying to get rich. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? I want to tell you a little story and I want to compare. In this little story, I'm going to take a snapshot of my life right now in 2025. I'm currently 30 years old. 3, 0. And I want to compare it with a snapshot of my life. Let's say five years ago. Yeah, five years ago it would have been 2020. That was when I was in the peak of my getting rich phase. 2020 was the year where I went from earning a hundred thousand a year on my YouTube business to like 1.2 million a year for my YouTube business for the regular. So 202020 was a massive year of growth. I want to talk about the idea of mental bandwidth and content. Content, content diet. So back in 2020, there were two types of content that I was consuming. Number one was fantasy fiction, audiobooks on my drive to and from work some of the time and while I was at the gym some of the time. That was maybe 10% of my content consumption. The other 90% of my content consumption was about getting rich. It wasn't explicitly about getting rich. Back in 2020, there wasn't that much content about it, but it was about business. It was about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to literally all of the podcasts about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to all of the podcasts about how to build a business and how to market a business. The Smart Passive Income podcast, the Online Marketing Made Easy podcast, Noah Kagan's podcast. I was reading all the books, listening to all the audiobooks about business, the E. Myth Revisited and Traction, and dozens and dozens of books and audiobooks about how to get rich. 90% of the stuff that I was consuming that I was listening to every single day at like two times and three times speed was content about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What that unhealthy obsession looks like is that in your discretionary time, in your spare time, the thing that you are thinking about the things, the thing that you're consuming content about the thing you're reading about the thing you're listening about, the things you are listening to, stuff about the thing you're watching videos on is on how to get rich. Going back to this friend, Jane, I also asked her, how much time do you spend watching or reading or listening to content that is specifically towards this goal of getting rich? And she said, well, I watched a lot of content about, like, content creation because I'm interested in that. I'm like, okay, but like, do you plan to get rich through content creation? And she was like, okay, probably not, right? She's doing the content creation thing as a hobby rather than as a vehicle to getting rich. And I was, okay, do you watch or listen or to read anything else about getting rich? And she was like, I sometimes watch some of your videos about finance and stuff, but other than that, not really. And so this is someone who has the goal of getting rich, which is like a 1% goal, because, you know, let's say rich is top 1%, however you want to define it, whatever. And she's putting zero hours a week towards the goal. Acting. Acting towards the goal of getting rich. And she's putting zero hours a week of consuming content towards the goal of getting rich. That is not what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like, unfortunately. Yeah. So back in 2020, when I was in the process of getting rich, when my income 10x'd, I was listening to some fantasy audiobooks, I was occasionally going to the gy, but literally all of the rest of my time, even while I was at work, in my day job, all of the rest of my time was focused on how do I do stuff towards building my business and therefore getting rich, or how do I learn stuff towards the goal of building my business and therefore getting rich. And my personal view is, I think that's what it takes. I think that's what it takes. It's so hard to get rich. It's not an easy thing. Social media will make you think it's an easy thing. Social media will make you think that you can, you know, get super rich. And while you're in the process of getting super rich, you can also have a balanced life, right? You can go to the gym, you can have your friends and family, you can go on the holidays, you can do the things, you can have so much fun. You can train for a marathon, you can do a hyrox, whatever the fuck a hyrux is. You can do all those things. In reality, those are the things that rich people do once they are already rich. They are not. The things that they did while they were on the way, while they were switching from day job earning 50 grand to business earning 500 grand, while they were growing the business from like, you know, 100k in revenue and no profit to a million in revenue and like lots of profit. Like generally, pretty much everyone I've spoken to who has been in that position has been unhealthily obsessed with the goal of getting rich or building a business or whatever the vehicle say words getting rich. They are unhealthy obsessed with that goal to the point that it has created imbalance in their life because they've been single mindedly pursuing that goal. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? You become unhealthily obsessed with goal. What else does an unhealthy obsession with a goal look like? So I talked about what my life was like back in 2020. I want to contrast that with what it's like in 2025. Let's have a look through my YouTube feed. A man's content feed can tell you a lot about what they value and what their priorities are. So let me show you what my YouTube feed looks like these days. Okay. A video from Alex O'Connor about philosophy. A community post from Leila Hormozi. A Gary's economics video about why growth is stupid. Okay. Oh, here we go. Simon Squibb. This is a video about how to get rich. I have one video about how to get rich. Method versus mythic. Sprocket monger. Lemonstock Lock and stock protection warrior pov. This is a video about World of Warcraft. This is not a video about getting rich. Shorts is this rogue genius? Another video about World of Warcraft. Why you can tax billionaires. This is a economics type thing. Another World of Warcraft thing. Oh, Alex Formosi video about getting rich. This new weapon modification is amazing. For speedruns in Horizon. Forbidden West. This is not a video about getting rich. This is a video about a video game. Hmm. Sahil Bloom quote. This is a video about how to get ripped, which is not about getting rich. This is a Dorover CEO episode about fear and anxiety. This is Rory Sutherland not about getting rich. I don't know what this is. This is another World of Warcraft video. Not a video about getting rich. This is an art video. Because I'm doing a side quest and learning how to draw. You know, bro is running side quests. I'm doing a side quest and I just completed Horizon Forbidden west on the PlayStation 5. I've gotten back into World of Warcraft, the War within season two on my character, which is a paladin where I'm trying to play Holy and Prot and retribution and stuff. I'm trying to learn how to draw. I'm running, running all these various different side quests. I'm taking Muay Thai lessons. I'm starting going to the gym very regularly. I'm taking squash lessons. Here's a book. This is one on how to get rich. I've read this book, by the way. It's a good book. This is music. Another side quest I'm running is trying to improve my guitar, piano and singing skills. Not a video about how to get rich. This is Lewis Howes and Jay Shetty, sort of a video about how to get rich, but not really. They're gonna talk about, like, feelings and stuff. World of Warcraft, Iman Ghazi video about how to get rich. So sell something. Video about how to get rich. Survive or thrive. I don't know what that means. Australian Grand Prix, Networking, storytelling. Not about rich. Not about getting rich. I worked out like David Goggins for a hundred days. Not about getting rich. My content feed these days reflects what my priorities are. If you were to look at that, what would you say are the things that Ali Abdel cares about according to his YouTube thing? According to his YouTube feed, he cares about World of Warcraft, cares about gaming on the horizon, Forbidden west cares, cares a little bit about making money. Because, you know, 20% of the videos are about how to get rich. Cares about becoming healthy. A handful of those videos were about, like, health and stuff. If you'd looked at this, like, two weeks ago, it was, like, filled with, like, baby gear recommendations. Cause I was on a fricking rabbit hole about, like, you know, we've got a baby on the way. And like, researching the absolute best crib, pram, stroller, car seat, this, that and the other. And so my entire YouTube feed was recommendations for, like, baby gear. If you compared this to my YouTube feed back in 2020, all you would have seen is content about how to get rich, content about how to build a business, content about how to manage a team, content about how to grow a YouTube channel, content about how to grow on social media, content about sales funnels and all of this sort of stuff. That's all you would have seen. This video is about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What does that look like? What it looks like is that your content diet is towards that unhealthy obsession with getting rich. The unfortunate truth is that the more different goals you're working towards, the more balanced your life is, the less likely you are to get rich. Maybe there are a handful of exceptions to this rule, but in general, the pattern I've seen through, I know, I know a hell of a lot of people who are rich. I've interviewed a lot of them on podcast, read a bunch of their books. None of basically 100% of them did not have much of a balanced life while they were in the process of getting rich. They started, they got rich first and then they got the balanced life second. I am not saying that this is what you should do. I am saying that if you have the goal of getting rich, any or, or becoming a professional athlete, or becoming a professional actor, or becoming a professional musician, anything where this is a goal that only 1% of people attain. Like, to be better than 99 of people requires you to be more dedicated than 99 of people generally requires you to work harder than 99 of people. People say, you know, work, but, but I can work smart. It's like, okay, but like everyone else is also trying to work smart. Like, also when you're a beginner at the thing, you don't know what working smart looks like. Like, when you're a beginner to the goal of getting rich, are you building business or whatever, you just have to work really hard. And in the process of working really hard, you will figure out, what does working smart look look like so that further down the line, you can now work smart. Right now I don't need to work that hard right now. My multi and deca millionaire friends don't need to work very hard. They still choose to anyway because they're kind of obsessed. Still, a lot of them are obsessed. But you know, the ones with families and like balance, they don't need to work very hard. Why? Because they have employees who do the hard work for them. They've got systems, they've got leverage, they've got personal brands, they've got books, they've got passive income assets. They don't need to work hard anymore. But all of them had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich while they were younger, when they were building it up. So if you're at this point in the video and you would like to get rich, it's really worth asking yourself, do you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Would your friends and family say that you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Does your content diet reflect an obsession with getting rich? Does the way you spend your time reflect an obsession with getting rich? If the answer is no, then you have two options. I think all of this is just my opinion. Whatever. I think you have two options here. Either you can decide to develop an unhealthy obsession. You can change your content diet. You can start consuming all the content about getting rich. You can start waking up two hours early before your day job, putting an effort towards building your business. You can start while you're at your day job, taking slightly longer lunch breaks and using, squeezing in half an hour of, like, work on your business here and there in the evenings. You can not go out with your friends every night or whatever thing. You can stop playing freaking video games. You can stop watching Netflix, stop watching random YouTube videos, even videos like this one and only. Ever work on your business while you're going on a walk, while you're doing the dishes. You can switch your content diet so that you are listening to audiobooks and podcasts and videos about getting rich. On weekends. You can be like, oh, weekends, incredible. I've got, like, 16 full hours on Saturday and 16 full hours on Sunday where I can literally just wake up, lock myself in a room, work for 16 straight hours on my business. That is what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like. That is often what it takes. Getting rich is not easy. That's option number one. If you decide that, hey, I want to get rich, I trust Ali's advice on this. I trust that he knows what he's talking about, sort of somewhat anecdotally, and I trust that, okay, I currently don't have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich, and I would like to develop one. Or you can decide. You know what? Actually, this. This isn't for me. I. If getting rich requires having an unhealthy obsession to the point where my life becomes imbalanced, if getting rich requires me to stop running my marathons and stop hanging out with friends and, like, work on the weekends and, like, wake up a bit earlier to work before work and, like, work during work, if getting rich requires my medical school professors to think I'm going to get struck off the medical register because, like, I'm so obsessed with getting rich, man, if that's what's required to get rich, I actually don't want to be rich. If that's the path you want to go down, man, I'm so glad you watched this video because this video might have saved you all of this angst that you've currently got from, like, you have a goal of getting rich, but you're not doing the thing, which is to have an unhealthy obsession in terms of action. And in terms of, like, learning towards getting rich, you could just decide to make the goal less ambitious on that front. I'm not putting a moral judgment on this. I'm not saying anyone should have a goal of getting rich. I'm not saying getting rich is a morally good thing or a morally bad thing. It's a morally neutral thing. In the same way, I'm not saying that being a professional football player is good or bad. It just. It just is what it is. If you have the goal of being a professional football player, it makes sense that you're either willing to put in the effort required to be a professional football player or not. But if you're not willing to put in the effort, you're not willing to pay the price that it takes to become a professional football player. Why set yourself the goal of becoming a professional football player? The more we have this gap, the gap between where we want, the gap between the thing that we want and the actions we're taking, this gap creates misery. Misery is created in the gap. If I have the goal of being a professional squash player, for example, I don't. But if I did, and I'm only training two hours a week, I'm like, bro, that's going to make me miserable because I'm never going to get to that goal by only 22 hours a week. Similarly, if you have the goal of getting rich and you're not willing to pay the price, which in my opinion is having an unhealthy obsession with it, to the point that the rest of your life becomes imbalanced if you're not willing to pay that price, either become willing to pay the price, that is, become unhealthily obsessed, or just don't have it as a goal. You know, various people in my team, for example, are totally chill not being rich. They do not have the goal of becoming financially free, financially independent. The ones that do often tend to go out and start their own business and then they make videos about why they left the Alibda team to start their own business and they've joined our team, got inspired and started to, and decided to run their own businesses. Cause they wanted to get rich, right? But there's a lot of people in my team who are like, you know what? I don't really wanna get rich. I just want a nice job that pays reasonably well, that gives me flexibility, that gives me fun, gives me autonomy, lets me learn, and lets me hang out with people that I like, and lets me travel the world while I'm doing it. That's actually the position of, like, half the people in my team. They're like, you know what? Actually, this is great. I love my job. I love my life. That's fantastic. They do not have the goal of getting rich. And therefore, the fact that they're not unhealthily obsessed with getting rich is fine. It's not causing any misery because there's. There's no misalignment. But there are various people I know, including Jane, for example, who has a job and has the goal of getting rich, which is there. And her actions are here. And she feels misery every day because she feels the pain of misalignment, the pain that her goals are misaligned with her actions. And whenever you're in a situation where what you want is misaligned with what you are doing, it creates misery. So either change what you're doing or change what you want. That's my honest advice. That's my hot take on how to get rich. And if you enjoyed that video, then you will absolutely love my weekly email newsletter. It's called Life Notes, and it's where I share whatever I'm learning, watching, listening to, and just notes that I'm generally taking away from my work and my life. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found this useful, and I'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:  \nThe video argues that achieving significant wealth typically requires an \"unhealthy obsession\" with money-making, often at the expense of work-life balance, relationships, or other priorities. Ali Abdaal shares his personal journey and observations of wealthy individuals, emphasizing that most successful people prioritize financial goals intensely during their wealth-building phase. He warns that misalignment between goals and actions leads to dissatisfaction, urging viewers to either commit fully to wealth-building or reevaluate their aspirations to avoid misery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Summaries:**  \n**[00:00-00:48] This is a video on how to get rich. When I was working as a doctor, no one ever asked me**  \nAli introduces the video by contrasting his early career as a doctor (where questions focused on productivity) with his current status as a multimillionaire entrepreneur. He notes that people now primarily ask him about wealth-building. He recounts a 2015 medical school incident where a professor predicted he’d become a millionaire but lose his medical license due to his money obsession, foreshadowing the video’s theme.  \n\n**[00:48-07:20] Ali Abdaal says he had an unhealthy obsession with making money**  \nAli admits he was unhealthily obsessed with money during his business growth phase, citing Reddit comments criticizing his fixation. He argues that most wealthy people (including billionaire Andrew Wilkinson) share this trait, often sacrificing relationships or family time. He acknowledges his luck in avoiding personal life fallout but warns viewers about potential regrets, referencing a friend who nearly divorced due to workaholism.  \n\n**[07:20-07:39] Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it professionally**  \nAli draws parallels between wealth-building and professional athletics, asserting that top performers in any field (e.g., actors like Timothée Chalamet) exhibit obsessive dedication. He critiques societal hypocrisy that praises obsession in arts/sports but frowns on it in finance, especially in cultures like the UK or Canada.  \n\n**[07:39-10:07] Timothy Chalamet talked about how he wants to be a great actor**  \nExpanding on the previous chapter, Ali highlights Timothée Chalamet’s public ambition to be a \"great actor\" as evidence of necessary obsession. He contrasts this with societal pressures to downplay ambition, arguing that \"try-hard\" attitudes are essential for exceptional success but stigmatized in financial contexts.  \n\n**[10:07-13:37] I was having a conversation with a friend who wants to be rich**  \nAli describes a conversation with \"Jane,\" a friend who claims to want wealth but spends no time on wealth-building activities. He critiques her divided focus (marathons, content creation, family) and explains that high-paying jobs outside tech/finance rarely lead to riches. He compares her lack of effort to the rigorous training of professional athletes.  \n\n**[13:37-14:18] What else does an unhealthy obsession look like?**  \nAli argues that obsession manifests in consuming content aligned with wealth-building. In 2020, 90% of his media intake (podcasts, books) focused on business growth. He contrasts this with Jane’s unrelated content habits, stressing that mental bandwidth must prioritize financial goals.  \n\n**[14:18-19:44] 90% of my content consumption in 2020 was about getting rich**  \nHe details his 2020 routine: listening to business podcasts (e.g., *Smart Passive Income*), reading books like *The E-Myth Revisited*, and sacrificing hobbies for work. He dismisses \"balanced life\" narratives during wealth-building phases, noting most rich friends achieved balance only after securing wealth.  \n\n**[19:44-25:34] Ali Abdaal's YouTube feed reflects what his priorities are**  \nAli analyzes his 2025 YouTube feed (gaming, philosophy, fitness) to show his shifted priorities post-wealth. He contrasts this with his 2020 feed (exclusively business content), illustrating how obsession evolves after financial success. He admits current \"side quests\" (art, gaming) are luxuries of already being rich.  \n\n**[25:34-28:03] Misaligned goals between what you want and what you are doing creates misery**  \nConcluding, Ali states that misaligned goals/actions cause unhappiness. He offers two choices: embrace obsession (adjust habits/content) or abandon the wealth goal. He frames financial ambition as morally neutral but stresses clarity to avoid regret, using his team members as examples of content non-wealth seekers.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Wealth-building often demands an \"unhealthy obsession\" that sidelines other life areas temporarily.  \n- Consistent focus (time, content consumption, habits) on financial goals is critical for success.  \n- Misalignment between aspirations and actions leads to dissatisfaction; reconciliation is essential.  \n- Societal judgment of financial ambition contrasts with acceptance of obsession in arts/sports.  \n- Post-wealth \"balance\" is common, but rarely achievable during the wealth-building phase.  \n\n**Tags:** wealth building, entrepreneurship, work-life balance, financial goals, obsession  \n\n**Insight/Outlook:**  \nThe pursuit of wealth forces a trade-off between short-term imbalance and long-term freedom, requiring individuals to consciously choose their priorities or risk enduring dissatisfaction from unaligned goals."}]}
