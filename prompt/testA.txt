The dumbest thing about Ali selling a productivity book is that he's not productive at all. I can't imagine putting myself in front of a camera and confidently chatting so much shit while having achieved so little of use. Oh, here we go. Wasted a spot in medicine for someone who could have actually had an impact on their community just for his self serving goals. What a beige human being. Wasted a spot in medicine. Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. This is going to be a bit of an interesting video because I am going to be reacting to some negative comments that, that people have written about me online. Now, generally I make it a policy to not look at negativity. But what I've been hearing a lot from creators and other entrepreneurs recently and people wanting to start out as a creator or as an entrepreneur is this fear of what will other people think of me? And also the fear of what if I get negative comments about me online? What if I get hit? What if I get criticism? I've been doing this stuff for the last seven years on the Internet and I think I've had my fair share of negative comments. I realized pretty quickly that it is the best policy is to just not look at the stuff. But for the sake of science, for the sake of this video, I asked my team to go through all of the sources they could find on the Internet to find the meanest comments that people have written about me. The most negative stuff. Honestly, I'm not sure if we're gonna publish this video. I only want to publish it if I think it'll be, it'll be useful or interesting. And so if I end up just sort of crying, that doesn't really particularly add much value to the viewer. But we're just gonna give it a go and we are gonna see what happens. It seems Ali's book is finally on pre order. I saw the COVID and amazed that Cal Newport said it's a much needed antidote to hustle culture. Like, dude, Ali is hustle culture. He thrives on it. He makes thousands to millions, millions on it. He thinks you have to watch an anime episode at four times speed. So either Ali has seriously changed his ways or this book's ideas came from someone else like his staff. And judging by his continued YouTube obsession with money, he has not changed his way. Hmm. So they clearly haven't read the book because the book is actually an antidote, I think, to hustle culture. This thing about how you have to watch an anime episode at full time speed. I made a video, you know, I wanted to catch up on anime that my brother had recommended to me. And I realized that if you watch it at two times or three times or four times speed, you can still read the subtitles and you can get what's going on. And then when it gets really epic, you can switch back to one time speed and then you can like absorb it. And I posted this video online and this, that video seems to have been sort of shared far and wide where people are holding it up as like, fuck this guy, hustle culture, the whole shebang. A comment like this doesn't really make me feel anything. The whole obsession with money thing is also interesting. Like, you know, I make no real secret of the fact that, hey, I'm an entrepreneur. Part of building a business is trying to make money out of it. The way you make money is by adding value to people. And, you know, if you add value to a lot of people, you make a lot of money. That sort of thing. I don't know, I don't think this one is. This one doesn't really, really affect me very much. From 2023. I wish that Ali would stop calling what he does teaching and education. He is not a qualified teacher. And regurgitating some book summaries every week, hosting a podcast and making courses based on anecdotal experience doesn't make you a teacher. Okay, that's interesting. I would actually really just disagree with this. I have a guitar teacher. He teaches me guitar. He does not have any qualifications in teaching, but he is still a guitar teacher because he's just one. A few steps further ahead of me on the, on the guitar learning journey. And he's better at the guitar than I am and has spent a lot of time like working on that skill. And therefore he's teaching me the skill. I refer to him as my guitar teacher. I think this sort of idea is something that really holds a lot of people back from sharing educational stuff online because they think that you have to be qualified in order to share something. You don't need to have a special qualification in order to share stuff that you think is useful on the Internet. You watching this right now? You're probably not a qualified teacher, but you could probably start a YouTube channel where you would, you would summarize books that you've read. You could probably start a Twitter account or a LinkedIn account where you would, I don't know, summarize lessons you've learned in your job over the last, like five to 10 years. If you're a student, you could probably, I don't know, Start an Instagram page where you share. Share your notes that you took when you were three years ago, two years ago and one year ago. All of this stuff, I would say, is teaching. It's sharing educational things that you hope might be useful to at least one person. I can appreciate the value of a teaching qualification. I was toying with the idea of doing a postgraduate certificate in medical education at some point, which in a way is a teaching qualification. But you know, just teaching that, it's just like, what is the definition of teaching? Define teaching. Impart knowledge or instruct someone as to how to do something. She taught him to read. He taught me how to ride a bike. Yeah, I think this is a, this is a stupid criticism. He is not a qualified teacher. And regurgitating some book summaries every week, hosting a podcast and making courses based on ideal experience doesn't make you a teacher. Okay, fair enough. Oh, by the way, in case you've not yet subscribed to Life Notes, you might like to. It is a completely free weekly ish email that I send and it contains the notes that I'm taking throughout life. So notes from books that I've read, podcasts I've listened to, videos I've watched, conversations I've had, experiences I've had. And I condense all that stuff into an email that I send to my subscribers once a week. It is completely free. If you think it's terrible, you can unsubscribe whenever you want. There'll be a link down below. Oh, here we go. Wasted a spot in medicine for someone who could have actually had an impact on their community just for his self serving goals. Absolute grifter and so far up his own ass. You sound jealous. Wait until you're on the wards being treated like a servant by the band five nurses while you're on. Â£15 an hour and come and come back to this. Wasted a spot in medicine. I do agree with this to an extent. I did waste a spot in medicine. I used to be a doctor. I went through med school for six years, worked as a doctor for two and a bit years, and then decided to go full time on this YouTube channel and career that I now have. And had I known that I had no intention of practicing medicine, had I known that I wouldn't practice medicine, I would not have applied to medical school. I get questions from students these days saying like, hey, I'm not really sure if I want to be a doctor. Should I do medicine anyway? And my answer is usually no, I think you should only do medicine if you know at that point that you think that you think you want to be a doctor. Having said that, I also think it is totally reasonable to change your mind. For example, I decided aged 14 or 15 that I wanted to be a doctor because that's the age in the UK where you have to decide what GCSEs you're doing and then you have to figure out what A levels you're doing and you have to start doing work experience and all of that shebang in order to have a chance of getting into med school. I decided age 14. Somewhere between age 14 and aged 26, I realized that actually I preferred the being an online entrepreneur more so than I preferred being a doctor. And I think it is totally reasonable to change your mind in that sense. Again, I I'm not making this video as a way of like kind of defending myself against all these comments because I genuinely, at least I think that I honestly could could not care less what these random commenters. But I'm sharing this because if, if just one person watches this. If, if you picked a career 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, you actually do not have to be wedded to that thing that you picked. You can if you realize that actually you building a life you love involves changing career. It's totally okay. Even if that career is medicine. Even if that career wasted a spot from someone else. We thankfully live in a society where you're not indentured into slavery to that thing that you decided to do 15 or 10 or 15 years ago. You are absolutely allowed to change your mind. The dumbest thing about Ali selling a productivity book is that he's not productive at all. He constantly talks about how he struggles to do things, for example Go to the gym. Correct. And his solution is always to pay someone to be his coach so he will do it. That's one of my, one of my solutions. That's not a solution possible for the vast majority of people and to be honest, suggests he actually struggles with tasks that most people can motivate themselves to do. Okay, his book has taken him years to write, and that's despite him asking his readers explicitly what he should put in it repeatedly. Why would I want his productivity advice when he couldn't even think it up himself? Also, as a side note, why has no one on his team told him to stop posting these terrible pouting pics of himself? He looks fine when he's not posing like girls used to in the 2010s, but he pulls the same idiotic face in every picnic. Honestly, it's hard to know how to react to something like this other than to be like, yeah, I mean, that's a fair point. I'm not productive in the sense of motivating myself to go to the gym, which is why I find strategies to use. The point of me writing a book about productivity was that I found some strategies. When I was working full time and trying to juggle growing a YouTube channel and a business, I found some strategies that really helped. I found the broaden and build theory from Barbara Fredrickson, the theory of positive emotions. The idea that feeling good about your work increases your productivity, reduces your stress, makes you more creative, gives you more energy to give to the other important areas of your life. I did, I did a bunch of research into intrinsic and extra extrinsic motivation and other forms of motivation, like identified and interjected motivation. Did a bunch of research into procrastination. Interviewed professors who specialize in studying procrastination. Put that into a book after trying some of the stuff myself, that I hoped would help people in some way. If this person does not want to read the book because they think that the fact that I struggle to go to the gym and motivate myself to the gym means that any productivity book I write is going to be shit, then that's okay. That's entirely fair enough. Also, his book has taken him years to write, and that's despite him asking readers explicitly what he should put in it repeatedly. Why would I want his productivity advice when he couldn't even think it up himself? I mean, me asking readers what to put in the book was focused around, like, what are readers struggling with? So that I know what the struggles of readers are so that I can address them in the book, rather than the book being purely my own personal experience. When you're writing a book, you've got to figure out, like, okay, who's your target audience and what are the problems that they have? So instead, it's not just an autobiographical account of, hey, these are the things I struggled with and what I did. It's like trying to find an angle that's like, okay, loads of people say they struggle with procrastination. Loads of people say they get distracted. Loads of people struggle with focus. Let me ask my audience, what are the things they struggle with? So that I can then figure out, like, what are the things to target in the book? I think I did also ask at some points, using Twitter and LinkedIn and stuff. Hey, I'm looking for an example of a story about this thing. Or I'm looking for a study that shows this thing. Or does anyone have any examples of a company that sort of came back from the brink of failure by applying the principle of play? And people gave me replies to those. Be like, hey, you should check out the story of LeBron James. You should check out the story of Adele and how she uses an alter ego. You should look at the story of Slack and how they pivoted from whatever their product was to get to the product at the end of the end of the thing. Yeah, I did absolutely use my audience. Use my audience in the sense of asking and polling people for first stuff for the book. I used to hate watch Ali's content, but it's so banal, monochrome and boring by now. I just check in every few weeks to see if anything controversial has happened. What a beige human being. Honestly, I've been called a lot worse than a beige human being. You know what? I'll take that beige human being. Sure. I can't imagine putting myself in front of a camera and confidently chatting so much shit when while having achieved so little of use for these comments, I'm really trying hard to really feel them. See, like, is there anything about this that, like, yeah, a sleep apple clearly can't imagine themselves in front of a camera while doing that. I can. I think this is also one of those things where people hold themselves back from doing stuff because they think they have to have achieved something in order to do the thing. Like, hey, in order to be sufficiently qualified to make videos on the Internet summarizing books, you must have achieved something major and then you're allowed to make videos summarizing books. I disagree with that principle. I think anyone, anyone watching this, anyone in the world can simply choose to get out their phone, make some videos, put them on social media, write some stuff, put it on Twitter and LinkedIn. One of the great things about the time that we're living in is that no one needs to give you permission. You don't need a qualification in order to do stuff. You can just do stuff and you can let the market decide whether it's good or not. So if you're watching this and thinking of doing something, I would not let comments like what a sleep apple is saying where basically implying that you have to have accomplished something in his eyes or her eyes. You have to have accomplished something before you're allowed to then make anything. Sharing your experiences. Encolift. Okay. Yeah, he's pretty intelligent on gifted. Oh, thanks. I meant his latest productivity videos. Early on, he had a lot of good advice, but these days it seems like his videos are done by a team. Yep, and he presents. That's why I preferred some of of his vlogs on his second channel. They detail more about his journey right now behind the scenes with his business, or even the podcast he would do with his brother. Both more useful and real than another productivity video. I broadly agree with that. Early on, my productivity videos were based on advice that I was learning and following at the time. These days, my productivity videos, occasionally they're based on, like, things that I have yet to learn. But, like, by this point, I've been doing this for seven years and reading about productivity for like 15. By this point, I've internalized a lot of sensible productivity advice. And so I make the videos not because they're a documentation of what I'm doing right now. Like, hey, guys, I just discovered this new productivity hack. I still do some of those occasionally, if I genuinely do, but I do them more because people in the audience ask. People in the audience are struggling with focus, distraction, procrastination. I don't particularly struggle with focus most of the time or distraction or procrastination, unless it's something I really don't want to do. And so I think, you know what, let me share some advice on this. That in the hope that it might be useful to at least one person. That is why I continue to do the vlogs. That is why I continue to do the podcast. My podcast, Deep Dive. It's just been conversations that I've had, I'm having with people where it's the conversation I want to have. My vlogs are designed to document the journey of what's happening right now. But the main channel videos about productivity are not aimed at an audience that feels like they've already gotten the value from them. I was speaking to a friend of mine called Ankur Waraku. He's like a huge YouTuber in India. And I really liked what he said. He said that if someone finds the content repetitive, congratulations, they have graduated from the course. And I really like that approach. If I went through the first year of med school again, I would find it a bit repetitive. And if I kept going to the same series of physiology lectures about respiratory physiology, at some point I would find it repetitive. That means great. It's now time for me to move on. I'd be more interested in the vlogs of my respiratory physiology lecturer. To be like, what's it? What's his research about compared to his physiology, respiratory physiology 101 course. I like his active recall videos. Thank you. But he also comes across as very arrogant and money orientated. Not sure why he did medicine in the first place after quitting following only two years as a doctor. Yep. See my previous comment about it's okay to change your mind. His poor personality also makes him very unattractive to me too. Oh, grapes and cake. Fair enough. You know when people meet me in real life, if they're like fans of the channel or whatever and they say hello to me, one thing that a lot of them spontaneously say, it's like, whoa, you're the same person in real life as you're on your YouTube channel. And I view, I personally view that as a compliment because it shows that I'm not trying to be anything other than what I am if someone thinks that I'm arrogant in real life or on the YouTube channel. Okay. Not everyone's personality is everyone else's cup of tea. Money orientated. Yeah, I'm pretty money orientated. I think making money is an important life skill. I think money buys you freedom to be able to do what you want. Freedom and flexibility. Since having money, my life is better than before I had money because now I'm in control of my time. I've also been giving away 10% of everything that I earned to charity since 2019. So the more money I make, the more money I can give away to charity as well. But yeah, I am pretty money orientated. I think money buys freedom, security, and allows you to do the things that you want and gives you more flexibility to build a life you love. Alright, here we go. He goes about his day filming a video and then has another camera recording him from a different angle while he does that, which he then releases a week later as a separate day in my life video. Yeah, I do sometimes. Is that a criticism? It's like, I'm filming this video. I'm not doing a vlog today, but if I were doing a vlog, I would be filming myself filming this video because this is a day in my life. I started the day off with breakfast at a local coffee shop and some journaling. Then my team came over and we had a bit of a chat, had some coffee, filmed a couple of videos. And if I'm documenting that in a vlog, I have another camera filming me, usually this bad boy, which is a little camera that I have on the side. And this is, this is a day in my life. Back in the day when I would do day in my life Vlogs. It would be when I was studying for my exams as a student. Then it would be when I was working as a doctor. Then it would be in the middle of the pandemic when I was trying to build a business. Then it would be when I moved to London and I had a team in an office and stuff. So the point of the day in the life vlogs this man. All right tn lifting. Oh, who's actually at FY2 foundation year two. He has millions of followers but has an ego fragile enough to get butt hurt from blatant troll comments by people without a profile picture on Instagram. Do I get butthurt from blatant troll comments from people on Instagram without a profile picture? I sometimes post them on my Instagram story. I didn't realize that that comes across as butthurt. I mostly post them for entertainment purposes because it's kind of funny. But grifter is going to grift and I can't fault him for that. He's good at what he does. Oh, thank you. What is a grifter? A person who engages in petty or small scale swindling. I'm curious, like what's, what's the swindling that these people think I do? I think people call anyone who sells an online course a grifter, but I know a lot of people who sell online courses. They're basically everyone I know who sells online courses. Very nice person and they have like no questions asked money back guarantees and like a full time staff of customer support people like I do. We have like five people on a customer support team so that when people email us and ask us questions, even if they bought a course five years ago, we still try our best to answer them and be super helpful to them. And so that anytime someone emails us asking for a refund for pretty much whatever reason, we just give them their money back. He likes money. He loves money. Nah dog, he lives for money. He gets orgasm thinking about money. He likes money just like how Homelander likes milk. But yeah, I do like money. I don't think I get an orgasm thinking about money because I think about money a lot. I also don't think I live for money. Who is Homelander? Homelander is the leader of the seven, the strongest supe in the world. The main antagonist of the Amazon series the Boys. Love that. That's actually just kind of funny. OMG. Ali said he charges 20k for a sponsored YouTube video. I want to cry. The payoff is he is probably soulless inside. He's a massive sellout. Yeah, we charged 20K. I think it's, it's increased now for a sponsored YouTube video. So if, if, if the theory is he should be a doctor and he quit medicine because he wanted to be a YouTuber for the money and therefore he's a sellout, it's like, yeah, I agree, I'm, I'm a sellout in that sense. I disagree that having a medical degree means you should be a doctor. And there are a lot of people doing careers outside of medicine who have medical degrees. I reserve the right to change my mind. I think that's probably what they're referring to as sellout, that he should have been doing something altruistic and low paid like medicine, but instead he chose to sell out. At one point I was thinking of moving to the US to do medicine there and a bunch of people were calling me a sellout then because it's like you should be a doctor in the UK where you're being paid Â£14 an hour, rather than try and move to the US where you get paid a lot more, still practicing medicine, possibly because you get paid more and, or there's a private healthcare system sort of in the US I think it's, it's interesting filming this video sort of seven years after the journey started. I actually did a video on my, on my podcast channel with my brother sort of reacting to mean comments maybe like 4 years ago. And in that video you can see that like I'm visibly upset by, by the comments because I think that was the first time that I'd really confronted negative comments. And sort of, that barrage really sort of like made me feel like. I think over time one, one of two things has happened. Either I have become better at dissociating from the ego. Maybe that's part of it because I've been reading a bunch of these spiritual books. I did an ayahuasca retreat about a year ago. I have had like a friend who's a kind of coach, therapist, slash spiritual guider in some way. Like all of these things that these people are saying are things that I've thought about myself at one point or another of like, is my content just meaningless? Am I just regurgitating shitty summaries from like popular books? Am I, have I lost any value I have to society because I once was a doctor and then decided not to be a doctor? Am I a sellout? Am I a grifter? Is that, is the stuff? Are the courses that we're selling actually, actually like really crap and we're just sort of scamming people out of their money, and they're so gullible that they're being scammed out of their money. It's like. Like all of these things are things that I've thought about myself at one point or another. And I've always come up with answers to that. Be like, no, I don't think it is. That's why we have a money back guarantee. If someone wants the money back, we give the money back. One thing I found helpful was, was to think what. What must be true for this comment to be correct. Like, am I a bad person for quitting medicine to do YouTube? I used to. I used to be really worried about that. And then I thought about it a lot and realized, no, I'm actually not. I don't agree with the principle that you should never change your mind on what career you want to do. I don't agree with the idea that if you signed up to do career X, even if career X is more altruistic, that you should then not switch to career Y because you realize career Y is more profitable, more fun, more fulfilling, more flexible, whatever the thing might be. And so, provided I don't agree with that assessment, do I still believe the initial criticism and the answer is no. And then it's almost like over time. Like the thing about, oh, I'm not sufficiently qualified to write a productivity book. The question is like, how qualified does one need to be to write a productivity book? How qualified does one need to be to write a book? Do I believe that in order to write a book and publish a book and have the audacity to sell a book or make videos or write blog posts that you need to have some sort of arbitrary qualification? No. Do I think the only people who get to share stuff online that might be helpful to others need a teaching qualification? No, I don't think so. So if that's true, then great. That criticism no longer has any legs. Well, one of the things I like about seeing. Seeing negative comments is that if I feel something about it, that then reveals an area where I'm like, ooh, that was a bit of ego defense there. It's like that specific comment about how Ali's content used to be valuable back when he was a real doctor, and now he's just a grifting entrepreneur and selling courses about how to be a YouTuber and so his content's no longer valuable. Oh, oh, there's something about that that's spicy. And the spiciness of that makes me Want to explore it a little bit more to understand, like, okay, exploring it with a sense of curiosity, a sense of like, do I agree with that? Do I disagree with that? Like, what are the reasons for that? Like, why do I feel this emotional response to that thing? So for these comments, like, most of the, most of my responses to this was just exasperation and frustration. Exasperation because I'm like this again, okay, fine. Exasperation because I'm like, do people have nothing better to do than make these sorts of comments online? But exasperation also because I think what these comments reveal is genuinely the stuff that holds people back from becoming creators. I'm finding myself sort of getting riled up by this, which is interesting because I think it shows that I feel fairly strongly about this because my whole shtick and whenever I have conversations with people where I see that, like, this fear of what other people will say is holding them back from living a life that could be way better than the one that they're currently living and they want to do it, but they're held back by this fear, this, like, negativity, this idea of, like, what are my friends and family going to think? What are the people in my university going to think? What are my cousins going to think? Oh my God, they're going to say that this person started a YouTube channel. Boohoo. It's like every single person I know who has started a YouTube channel, who started a business, has had naysayers early on in their journey. And then as you get become more and more successful, you have even more of them. But every person I know who has done this and succeeded in fairness, so there's some survivorship bias, has not regretted that decision. They've said it's one of the best decisions they've ever made. Even people I know who have started YouTube channels and quit two years later because they didn't go anywhere have still not regretted it because they've learned a lot about themselves. They learn new skills, they overcame some, like, emotional hurdles, all of that stuff. And I think it is such a shame when comments like this on a random, like gossip forums or random subreddits where people read those comments. It's like, I'm probably not going to make it a habit to read the comments. So people commenting the stuff doesn't actually affect me. But what it does is that for the other thousands of people that are reading those comments, it reinforces to them the idea that, no, you know, the crabs in a bucket thing, I can't possibly, like, I can't possibly try and do my own thing. I can't possibly try and break free from this barrel that I'm in because the other crabs are going to drag me down. And what I see from these comments is like the crabs in a crabs in a bucket thing. These are crabs trying to drag trying to drag other people down. It doesn't affect me. I'm rich enough. I've got a business. I can kind of do what I want. But it affects those people that are not doing the thing because they're worried about this sort of response, which I think is where the sense of, like, exasperation comes from. So this is probably a very long and rambly video, if you've gotten to this point. Thank you for watching. I hope you got some value out of this video. But yeah, yeah, thanks for watching. See you next time. Bye.
