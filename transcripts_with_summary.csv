audio_1.mp3,"Okay, so if you've ever felt really sad and tired all the time, you've probably found yourself trapped in this cycle of feeling bad for yourself. And so you don't end up doing anything healthy or productive, which makes you feel even worse about yourself, and you end up getting stuck in this sort of negative spiral and then it becomes very difficult to get out. Now, I recently interviewed a neuroscientist about how the key to unlocking all of this stuff is the chemical serotonin. So you'll notice that if you get some really good sleep, or you spend some time walking out in the sunshine, or you eat a big plate of fruit, for example, a mood elevation will actually occur. And that's our brain simply trying to reinforce the natural way of being as a human. And that's why it's effectively affecting our emotional balance. If on the other side, you do eat some really unhealthy food, you spend all your day inside, you don't sleep very well, your mood will dip. And effectively, your mood is a really clever communication pathway between your brain and body, guiding us to engage in a more healthy way of being. This is TJ Power, a neuroscientist who runs the Dose Lab, which specializes in understanding the four main brain chemicals that influence our day to day lives. And dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins. And very excitingly, we are exploring each one of these in a four part video series. And so today we are going to be looking at serotonin, how it influences our mood and five simple habits, simple things we can do to improve our mood so that hopefully we never find ourselves stuck in a rut or burnt out with low mood and energy levels. Part one, the second brain. So we all obviously have these incredibly complex brains that control pretty much everything we do and how we feel and what we say and who we kind of are as people. But you might have heard yourself say things like, I've got butterflies in my stomach or I need to trust my gut, or I'm shitting myself if you're really scared. Now, on one level, these are just phrases that we throw around in conversation, but from a scientific perspective, they actually do hold a lot of truth. And that is because our gut is also known as the second brain. This is not the productivity bro type second brain. This is like the science bro second brain. There are more than 100 million nerve cells in our gut, and our brain and gut communicate with each other all the time through what's called the gut brain axis and the Hormone serotonin has a really big influence on their communication. This is the chemical responsible for our mood and our energy. And the most important thing to understand about this chemical is 90% of it is being made in our gut. Our brain and body is constantly assessing how healthy our body actually is. And if the body is in a good state, if it's well rested, if it's got sunlight, if it's got loads of good nutrient dense foods in, it leads to an increase in serotonin in the gut, which then improves how we feel in our mind. And then on the flip side, if our serotonin levels decrease, then our mood and energy levels will be pretty low as well. Now, there are two main reasons why this is the case. The first thing is because of your vagus nerve. And this is the part of the nervous system that connects our brain to a bunch of other important organs in the body, including the heart and the stomach and the intestines of the gut. And crucially, serotonin influences the signals that are sent from the gut to the brain through the vagus nerve. So if our gut makes less serotonin, then there's gonna be a change in the signals sent along the vagus nerve and ultimately that will result in changes to our brain. So the chemical serotonin influences communication of the vagus nerve. And then the second thing to understand about serotonin, before we get into the practical tips, is that serotonin is made from an amino acid called tryptophan. And tryptophan from our diets travels into the brain where then the brain converts it into serotonin. And so if we are not getting enough tryptophan through our diet, then we won't be able to make enough serotonin in the brain. So the key takeaway here is to remember that if we want to improve our mood and feel more energized and just generally feel better overall, we, we need to think about how we can support both our brain and our gut in making more serotonin. And if you do things to boost your serotonin levels, then you're going to feel happier and more energized, which will then reinforce those healthy behaviors to keep our serotonin levels high. So let's now look at five actionable and evidence based ways to boost our serotonin, starting with the law of serotonin. Interestingly, the law of serotonin is to make sure you walk headphone free in nature every day. And that actually goes on to have an impact on all aspects of serotonin which covers things like our nutrition, our sleep, quantity of sunlight, even down to how our body breathes effectively with serotonin. The whole thing is about getting our system more aligned to nature and how it originally spent its time. So in Japan, they've got this practice called shinrin yoku, which literally means forest bathing, which is basically where you spend some time in a forest walking around and looking at what is around you. And a researcher actually ran an A B test on students to actually test does this forest thing actually work? Is it legit? So they took a bunch of university students and they had them spend one day in a forest doing shinrin yoku, and then a second day doing the exact same thing, like walking around and looking around, but in a big city rather than in a forest. And the results of this study were actually really impressive. They wrote that forest environments promote lower concentrations of cortisol, which is our stress hormone, Lower pulse rate, lower blood pressure, greater parasympathetic nerve activity, and lower sympathetic nerve activity than do city environments. Now, as you might know, the parasympathetic nerve is that branch of the nervous system that causes us to feel chill and relaxed. So more activity in the parasympathetic system and less activity in the sympathetic system, which is our sort of fight and flight, kind of like wired kind of nervous system that essentially promotes the feeling of relaxation and reduces our stress levels. We as a species are only at home when we're in nature. That is human's original home. We spent 300,000 years nowhere else. That's all there was to spend our time in. Forests, beaches, mountains, whatever it may be. I actually believe this is the most important thing in all of this dose theory is spending time in natural environments. The reason I believe that is humans are extremely misaligned to our former hunter gatherer self. And the more you can become a hunter gatherer in the modern world, the more you're going to thrive from a productivity point of view, from a relationship point of view, health, mood, energy, whatever it may be. So really, the goal here is to make sure that ideally, we are spending some time in nature every single day, even if that means cycling or walking to a local park. If you live in a big city here, like I do now, while we're there in these green spaces, we want to be, ideally, trying to activate all of our senses. And so we want to be a little bit mindful about what we hear and see and smell and feel. And there is some interesting evidence that walking barefoot on grass is great too, because it has what people call a grounding effect that more research on this topic definitely needs to be done. But the basic idea is that we as humans have a slightly positive electric charge in our bodies and the earth has a slightly negative electric charge. And so in theory, if we expose our skin directly to the earth's surface, the then there is a transfer of electrons and that balances out the charge and that theoretically makes us feel less stressed. I've yet to find any major scientific evidence as to whether this works, but a bunch of traditions from around the world outside of the west say that this is, you know, this is a core part of their traditions. And also I know a bunch of people who swear by grounding. And so it is something I do want to experiment with a little bit more myself.

So thank you Brilliant for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. Action number two Sunlight before Socials okay, so if you've seen any of my videos about sleep or if you listen to any of Andrew Huberman's stuff, you will know that getting sunlight exposure in the morning has a bunch of benefits. Firstly, it increases our cortisol levels. First thing in the morning, and that helps us feel more awake. Secondly, it synchronizes our internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, with the environmental day night cycle. And so the idea is that you then feel sleepy at the right time in the evening. But what's also really interesting is that the sunlight signal tells our brain to make serotonin, and so we feel happier and more energized for the rest of the day. And this is obviously a much better way to start your day than scrolling through social media, which a lot of us tend to do in the absence of something better to do. An important note is that even if it's cloudy, you still get the benefit. You just need slightly longer out there. On a really sunny day, you'd need about five minutes. On a really cloudy day, you'd need about 15 minutes of morning sunlight in order to get the system started. Action number three, Happy gut, happy brain. Okay, so action number three is all about then improving our gut health, because we know that this is where we make 90% of our serotonin. And as we've talked about, the gut has these strong connections to our brain through the gut brain axis. Daily consumption of a probiotic supplement could have a positive effect in improving the mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms present in major depressive disorder. And this might be because probiotics are essentially trying to do the same thing as some branches of antidepressant medications in that they are trying to increase our levels of serotonin. But rather than being drugs, probiotics are actually much more natural. They're basically foods or supplements that contain live microorganisms like bacteria and yeasts. And all of these can help promote a healthy balance of microorganisms in our gut. There are also probiotic foods, and these are things like kombucha and kimchi and sauerkraut, however you pronounce that, and tempeh and even cheese and yogurt can be probiotic. But on top of probiotics, it's also important that we eat nutrient dense foods with lots of fiber, because that helps our bodies make serotonin. And generally, the healthier your diet, the better you're going to feel overall. Biggest challenge we have in the modern world is we've got all these ultra processed foods entering our gut. Ultra processed food has become a massive topic now in the last few years. And as these foods enter our body, our body's capacity to make serotonin is the least of its priority. The priority is then removing these toxic products from it, and then our serotonin Levels dip. And so many of us are now struggling with the feeling of exhaustion and low mood. And that is heavily connected to the nutrients in the foods that we're eating. Ultra processed foods are things like sweets and chocolate and cakes and all of the stuff that we find in bright, colorful packaging filled with a long, long list of ingredients. And there are two key questions that you can ask yourself to work out if something is going to help you make serotonin or not. Firstly, could this food have been on earth before humans got here? And so these would be single ingredient whole foods like fruits and vegetables and beans and even things that you can cook like rice and potatoes. And the second question is, do I recognize all of the ingredients? If the answer is yes, then probably the food is not that processed and is probably better for you. But if the answer is no, and there is a long list of ingredients that you can't pronounce or you don't know what they are, or there's sort of these, like all these chemicals and stuff, then chances are the food is more likely to be processed or even ultra processed and probably isn't too good for your serotonin levels. This is an important point to emphasize. Back when I was working in medicine, we saw loads and loads of people with depression. We saw loads of people, loads of people with major depressive disorder and also with sort of like mild depression. And generally most of these people didn't have healthy diets. It obviously is, you know, correlation, causation, all that kind of stuff. But for most people watching this, like your diet is probably under your control to a pretty large degree. And so you're just like leaving money on the table by, or like leaving happiness points on the table by having a really shitty diet. So yeah, just saying action number four, in for four, out for six. What we see from a serotonin perspective is if the body is breathing very slowly, serotonin levels will rise because the body is getting into a calmer state. Now this is because slow, deep breathing activates our parasympathetic nervous system, which, as we talked about, is our relaxing Y type nervous system. That puts us into a state of rest and digest. And to help with that, there is this technique called resonance breathing. Effectively with resonance breathing, trying to breathe just six times a minute. How you do that is you try and make your breathing round, take 10 seconds. So then you only do six, 10 second chunks. In order to do that, you do four seconds in and six seconds out. In fact, why don't we try this now? So if you Are like me and you watch every video at 2x speed. It's now time to shift the speed setting back to one time speed because we're going to do a little bit of guided breathing. So we are gonna inhale, 2, 3, 4, exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And let's do one more round. Inhale, 2, 3, 4,. Exhale, 2, 3, four, five, six. You get the idea. Even, like, even me, as I've been doing, I'm just like, I just feel a little bit better in myself from just breathing a little bit slowly. It's weird. Anyone can do this literally at any point. And it's just so easy to forget that we have so much control over our physiology based on how we choose to breathe. And it's just, you know, this is why part of anger management, part of like energy management is a lot of it is the breath. The breath connects to pretty much every aspect of our nervous system or rather some of the key aspects of our nervous system. And so it's just again, we've got free happiness points that are just there if we can do a little bit of funky stuff with our breathing. And then action. Five delta sleep. Okay, so this last action is all to do with our sleep. And the interesting thing about serotonin at night is that this chemical mostly switches off at night time, especially during deep sleep, which is also known as delta wave sleep. And this lets our serotonin receptors almost go through this kind of reset period. So the next day they're more sensitive to serotonin binding to them and therefore the same amount of serotonin becomes more effective. This is probably why you might have noticed that if you don't get enough sleep, you feel kind of cranky in the morning. A big part of this is because your serotonin receptors haven't had the chance to reset. And getting enough of this deep sleep all starts with having a healthy wind down routine. There's a lot of different sleep strategies out there in the world, but what I really want people to understand is your brain needs to go through a calming period before it then enters sleep. You don't want to be burning it out with social media as the final thing that you do. So in an ideal world, we wouldn't be looking at our phone at all before we go to bed and we would do something like resonance breathing or reading to enter this calming period. As TJ talks about my case, I read on my Kindle at nighttime and generally the books that I read at nighttime these days are spirituality type books. I'm currently, currently reading Living Untethered by Michael Singer, which is amazing if you're interested into that kind of stuff. The Power of Now, the Untethered Soul, the Surrender Experiment. This is some good stuff and it's so calming and it's so nice and I love it. But if for whatever reason you are on your phone in the evening, then there's sensible things that you can do, like turn down the brightness and turn on like the night mode thing that makes the light yellow rather than blue. Make sure the screen isn't too close to your eyes. And in particular, watching high octane, high energy, high dopamine short form content is a terrible thing for your brain because then it's sort of like going in all these frazzled circles. So if you do need, need to watch something. I don't need to watch anything before bed. But if you, if you're telling yourself the story that, oh, I need to watch stuff to relax before sleeping, try and try and make it long form content rather than short form content. On that note, it just generally amazes me how many people sleep seem to convince themselves that they have to do unhealthy things in order to, like, survive, you know, oh, I have to watch two hours of Netflix to wind down in the evening. No, you don't. If you had something better to do, you wouldn't watch those two hours of Netflix. If you had like a really interesting social thing to do, or you were playing sports, you were doing something you genuinely enjoyed, you wouldn't have to, you know, use Netflix for those two hours. And if you found yourself on like a camping trip or something, you wouldn't have to watch Netflix for two hours to wind down. It's worth considering. And you know, I do this myself, so this is sort of notes to myself. It's worth us considering. What are the arbitrary rules that we've made up for ourselves and are they serving us? If they're serving us, great. I'm all in favor of arbitrary rules that serve us, but if they're not serving us, then why are we doing it? Do you really need to watch Instagram Reels for 60 minutes to wind down? Probably not. So why bother making that rule for yourself? I don't know. Anyway, that brings us to the end of this video. I hope you enjoyed it. This playlist over here has the other three videos in our series about dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. So check out that playlist if you haven't yet seen those videos, and I will see you hopefully in the next video.

This video explores serotonin's role in mood regulation and energy levels, emphasizing its production in the gut and offering five evidence-based habits to boost it. Key strategies include spending time in nature, morning sunlight exposure, improving gut health through diet, practicing slow breathing, and prioritizing deep sleep. The video integrates neuroscience insights, practical tips, and references to studies, while also promoting the sponsor Brilliant for interactive learning.

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:17] Today we are looking at how serotonin affects our mood and five simple habits**  
The video opens by explaining how serotonin influences emotional balance and serves as a communication pathway between the brain and body. Neuroscientist TJ Power highlights serotonin’s role in reinforcing healthy behaviors (e.g., sleep, sunlight, nutritious food) and its decline with unhealthy habits. The segment introduces the series’ focus on serotonin and outlines five actionable habits to avoid low mood and burnout.  

**[01:17-03:29] 90% of our serotonin is made in our gut**  
The ""second brain"" (the gut) houses 100 million nerve cells and produces 90% of serotonin via the gut-brain axis. Serotonin synthesis depends on tryptophan from the diet and vagus nerve communication. Poor gut health—linked to ultra-processed foods—reduces serotonin, worsening mood. Probiotics, fiber-rich diets, and whole foods are emphasized as critical for serotonin production.  

**[03:29-06:27] The law of serotonin recommends spending time in nature to boost serotonin**  
Forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) is cited as a practice that lowers stress hormones and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Studies show nature exposure improves relaxation compared to urban environments. The segment advocates daily nature immersion, sensory mindfulness, and grounding (walking barefoot), noting anecdotal benefits despite limited scientific validation.  

**[06:27-07:33] Brilliant is a fantastic platform where you learn by doing**  
A sponsored segment promotes Brilliant’s interactive learning platform for STEM topics. It highlights problem-solving over memorization, courses in Python/AI, and free 30-day trials. The host shares personal use and endorses its alignment with critical thinking.  

**[07:33-12:43] Getting sunlight exposure in the morning has a bunch of benefits**  
Morning sunlight synchronizes circadian rhythms, boosts cortisol (for alertness), and triggers serotonin production. Recommendations include 5–15 minutes of exposure (even on cloudy days) and avoiding social media upon waking. The science ties sunlight to mood elevation and energy regulation.  

**[12:43-15:16] Getting enough sleep starts with having a healthy wind down routine**  
Deep sleep (delta wave sleep) resets serotonin receptors, enhancing next-day sensitivity. A calming pre-sleep routine—reading, avoiding screens, and resonance breathing—is advised. The host critiques reliance on Netflix/Reels for winding down, advocating mindful alternatives like spirituality books.  

**[15:16-15:28] This video is part of a series about dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin**  
A closing note directs viewers to the full series on brain chemicals (dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins), with a playlist link for further exploration.  

Key Points:  
- 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut, influenced by diet, probiotics, and gut-brain axis communication.  
- Daily nature exposure reduces stress hormones and aligns the nervous system with natural rhythms.  
- Morning sunlight regulates circadian rhythms, boosts cortisol, and stimulates serotonin synthesis.  
- Ultra-processed foods disrupt gut health, lowering serotonin and contributing to low mood.  
- Deep sleep resets serotonin receptors, requiring calming pre-sleep routines (e.g., reading, breathing).

Insight/Outlook: Optimizing serotonin through natural habits (diet, nature, sunlight, sleep) may become a cornerstone of holistic mental health strategies as society shifts toward non-pharmaceutical wellness approaches."
audio_2.mp3,"All right, so oxytocin is known as the love hormone. And I recently spoke to a neuroscientist all about why we need to understand how it works in our brain. This is the chemical that is completely designed to connect humanity together. And it has a big effect on both our relationships, but also our confidence in how we connect with ourselves. So this is driving the experience of love as a species. That is TJ Power, a neuroscientist who runs the Dose Lab, which specializes in understanding the four main brain chemicals that influence our day to day lives. Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. And very excitingly, here on the channel, we are exploring each one of these in this four part video series. So this video is all about oxytocin and five ways we can boost our oxytocin levels so that we feel more connected with others and with ourselves, so that we can ultimately become happier. Part one, the Law of Oxytocin. I would say at the human core, oxytocin is actually the most desirable chemical. In order for humans to procreate and survive, oxytocin has driven us to have relationships. And as much as we all seek for finance and wealth and things like that, a lot of what we're really seeking for is love and a family and relationships. And if you satisfy your oxytocin, your brain is going to be much calmer, it's going to be much more confident, it's going to be a happier experience within your mind, and you are generally going to feel much more fulfilled in your life if your oxytocin is high. Now, oxytocin is known as the love hormone because it's involved in bonding with others. And one of the best ways to increase oxytocin is through what TJ calls the law of oxytocin. The law of oxytocin is to make someone else in your life happy every day. And any time in which you're helping someone else to feel happy, oxytocin doesn't just rise in them because they're experiencing human connection. We fundamentally feel way happier as a human when we contribute to their life. Part 2 Five actions to increase Oxytocin all right, so if we're thinking of actionable ways to increase our levels of oxytocin so that we feel more connected to ourselves and to others, and so we become happier overall. The first is directly related to the law of oxytocin, which is acts of kindness. Okay, so in 2007, a bunch of Researchers wanted to find out more about what made humans do generous things. Generous things like helping a stranger in need or volunteering for a non profit organization or, you know, going on Amazon and leaving a nice review for Ali Abdal's book, Feel Good Productivity. So to investigate the spirit of generosity, they randomly split a group of people into two groups. Now, one group was given oxytocin in the form of a nasal spray, so the oxytocin reached the brain directly. And the other group, the placebo group, was given a spray that did not contain the chemical. And then they all played some computer games which involved giving money to a stranger. And this is what the results show. So this is the placebo group and this is on average how much money they gave away to a stranger. But this is the oxytocin group and this is how much money they gave away to a stranger. As the researcher said, those on oxytocin were 80% more generous than those given a placebo. So together with being more generous will form better social relationships and release more oxytocin in this positive feedback loop. And so boosting our oxytocin levels in the first place. All starts with random acts of kind. There's this really good episode of Friends, the TV show where Joey says to Phoebe that there's no such thing as a selfless good deed. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry, yes, there are. There are totally good deeds that are selfless. And in this episode, Phoebe tries to do kind things for other people. So without feeling good herself. So she, for example, goes and rakes someone's garden leaves without them knowing, so they have a good deed done. But what she ultimately discovers in this episode is it's fundamentally impossible to do something for someone else and not feel good yourself. And it's very important to, on a regular basis, just have that in your mind. Like, how am I serving other people, family, friends, colleagues, kids, whatever it might be? Because the more you serve others, the happier you will feel as a result. In my case, one of the things that I realized when I was working as a doctor in a previous life is that it would just be an uplift to my own day if I offered to make the nurses a cup of tea. So a few times throughout the day, you know, I'd be doing my, like, paperwork or whatever and I'd take a break, I'd go make myself a cup of tea, and then on the way I'd stop off at the nurse's office and ask if anyone would like a cup of tea mostly would say yes. And it wasn't much skin off my own back to make a few extra cups of tea. Cause either way, I was gonna make the tea for myself. So I, you know, might as well make three extra teas, One with sugar, one with coffee, creamer, you know, all that kind of stuff. But when I would give the nurses the tea, they would feel really happy, and I would feel really happy as well. I'd be like, oh, I just did a nice thing for someone. It's like, it didn't cost me anything. It was super nice, super easy to do. And I found that it just lifted up my energy and lifted up my mood so that especially during the dark days of the pandemic, when everything was all miserable and depressing for people who worked in hospitals and everyone else, it was just. It was a real difference in, like, the. The energy and the approach that I took to my work. This is something I talk about in my book, Field of Productivity. Basically, the idea that is super backed up by science that if we can do nice things for other people, people are a source of energy. And so we can turn our work into a source of energy by doing these random acts of kindness or by trying to connect whatever we're doing to the impact it might have on someone else, even if it's something as small as making someone a cup of tea. Okay, so we want to be asking ourselves these two questions. So firstly, at the start of the day, you can ask yourself, what can I do to make someone else happy today? And then at the end of the day, you could ask yourself, what simple contribution have I made today? And this is a way of connecting the stuff that you've done with the impact it has on other people. And in theory, that should boost your oxytocin levels and help you feel happier. By the way, singing with a group of people or doing exercise with a group of people, or working with a group of people makes whatever you're doing feel much better. And that is where the sponsor of this video comes in, which is actually me, because this video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab. If you're the sort of person who works from home a lot, maybe in your day job, or maybe on your side Hustle or your book project or your memoir or your YouTube channel or whatever, and you find yourself sitting at the computer and then not actually doing the thing that you intended to do, then Productivity Lab is going to be absolutely perfect for you. Essentially, Productivity Lab is an online platform and community of entrepreneurs and creators and professionals and we all get together and we work together through Focus Labs. We do reflective workshops each week where you reflect on how your week has gone and set goals and plan your next week. So it sort of serves as an accountability mechanism. And I like to think of it as like CrossFit or Peloton for productivity. You're joining a Zoom co working session with other people. I joined these for three hours each morning because I just get way more work done when I'm in a Focus Lab session. Knowing that other people around me on screen virtually are also doing their work and doing this stuff every day pretty much doubles my productivity. And we've had so many success stories from students in Productivity Lab who've said things like, hey, you know, I've been procrastinating on starting my YouTube channel for ages and then I joined Focus Lab sessions and now I've actually done it. Or things like, you know, I've spent five years planning to make this new iOS app that I've been planning to make and then I never actually did it, but then I joined a few Focus Lab sessions and now I've built my minimum viable product. And so students in Productivity Lab are getting a lot of good results. There's a link down below. You can check out productivity lab.com and you can see if it's a sort of thing that might be right for you. And who knows, maybe I will see you in one of our coworking sessions or in one of our reflection workshops or in one of our planning sessions or in one of our book clubs or, or maybe in one of our in person meetups as well. Action number two is the hug habit. So obviously during the pandemic we all had these social distancing regulations in place and we couldn't see people in person and we couldn't hug or high five or shake hands. We had to do those weird like, you know, elbow bumping, Y type situations. And the lack of all these things probably contributed to the unhappiness that we saw a lot during the pandemic, even outside of the health effects of the pandemic. Because, for example, we know that physical touch reduces short term stress, it improves immune system functioning and, and physical touch, like massages, have been found to have a positive impact on depression as well. And there's this interesting survey, the Longing for Touch questionnaire. And they found that during the pandemic, 86% of people desired more physical touch. And then after Covid, that number is still pretty high at around 80%. When I'm on stage I explain this idea that humans really need physical connection. And I get the entire audience to rate how many hugs they think they're averaging per day. On average of all 50,000 people, we're at 1.6 hugs a day is what we've seen in our data. And when you look into the research, it's very clear that we need much more like five hugs a day. Now, when we hug someone, we release oxytocin in our brains. And I think I read somewhere that if you hug someone for six seconds, that's sort of like, you know, the optimal oxytocin release, which feels like kind of long. And I would, you know, when I first read this a couple of years ago, I started giving really long hugs to some of my friends and I would, you know, they'd be like, huh, that was, that was unusual. And I had to be like, oh, I read this thing, you know, saying that oxytocin, six seconds, blah, blah, blah. And I sort of felt a bit embarrassed about it and I've sort of lost the habit, but it's something I should probably reinstate in like a non weird way. Action number three, eyes and ears. Now, there are unfortunately certain things in our life that stop us from connecting with others in a meaningful way. And these things stop oxytocin levels from rising in our brain. And as you can imagine, the biggest culprits of this are firstly, our phones, and secondly, social media. And these things are bad for oxytocin levels for three main reasons. So firstly, the phones and social media reinforce individualistic behavior. So instead of us being more outwardly focused, we're always thinking about our own profiles and how many likes we've got and posting about our own lives and comparing our lives to other people, which is not good for our mental health and certainly not good for our oxytocin levels. Secondly, phones and social media have been shown to make us feel pretty lonely. The challenge I have with this is, I think it's actually creating a lack of desire to pursue meaningful oxytocin because we're moderately satisfying. This deep human need to connect with one another. If we spend a lot of our time moderately satisfying this chemical, eventually the chemical begins to kick back and it will actually increase feelings of loneliness within our brain because it's trying to create a greater desire to actually pursue meaningful connection. And thirdly, our phones act as this sort of barrier between us and the people in the outside world that we're trying to connect with in real life. They stop us from making eye contact with Others, which obviously we know is a good thing for social bonding, but they also prevent us from actively listening to what the other person is saying. The way to know if you're actively listening is when you're listening to someone. And I've struggled with this a lot. It's very easy to actually spend your time formulating your response in your head to what they're saying whilst they're talking. So you're not actually really listening, you're just in your mind creating something that you're going to say back next. Active listening is just taking the time to listen and then respond. Taking the time to listen and then respond. And so one tip that people often say for improving your social skills, boosting your oxytocin levels, helping yourself be happier, making yourself feel more connected to the people around you, is to think eyes and ears. Making eye contact with a person, the eyes and then ears, in terms of actively listening to them. And I really shouldn't have to say this, but, you know, I fall into this trap myself sometimes. The phone is on the table, the watch pings with a notification from slack or from WhatsApp or something, and it's like someone's trying to talk to me, but then I'm like, should I look at the watch? Like, would it be rude? And it's like my mind is now on the notification or on that thing that's just happened, rather than on the human being who's literally in front of me. And, yeah, something I need to work on. And, you know, maybe you might get some value from that little tip. Eyes and ears as well. All right, next up, we have action number four, which is to celebrate the wins. About a year ago, year and a half ago, I spent some time in Austin, Texas, and I was hanging out with Chris Williamson, who you might know from the Modern Wisdom podcast. And Chris very kindly invited me along that day to go on a boat with a guy called Bill Perkins, who's a mate of Chris. And Bill Perkins is the guy who wrote a book called Die With Zero, which I'd actually done a book club video about at some point. And so Chris connected me to Bill Perkins. And so I spent the day with these two really cool dudes, Chris and Bill. And I asked Bill a load of questions because, you know, he's in his 50s, he's like a billionaire. And me and Chris, we're similar ages, and Bill is sort of like in his 50s. And so we were asking him for some life advice. He said two things. The first thing he said was that the Single most positive return on investment he has ever made in his life was in getting a relationships therapist. You know, relationship therapy is given a bit of a bad rep. It's something that couples only go through if they're going through a hard time. But actually we should be thinking of it more as like a personal trainer at the gym in that, like, it's not someone you go to when you're injured, it's someone you go to to prevent yourself getting injured while you're doing the exercises. And so he was like fully recommending a relationship therapist even if. Especially if you don't have problems in your relationship. And so I decided the following week I was going to book a relationship therapist. And me and my wife Izzy, who's now my wife, have been seeing this relationship therapist regularly for the last 12 months, thanks to the tip from Bill. But the second thing that Bill said is that we should celebrate more wins. And that is Action four celebrating the wins. And this has two big, big impacts on us. One is that it creates much more positive experience in our brain and our confidence will then increase as a result of us talking to ourself in a much more positive way. The other is actually really impacts our capacity to succeed on whatever we're seeking to attain. If you're watching this channel, you're probably a bit of a high achiever. You probably care about productivity, you're probably very good looking. You are probably like me in that we collectively don't have much of a tendency to celebrate the wins. We tend to, you know, people with our form of neuroses tend to, you know, you set a goal, you work towards the goal, you achieve the goal. You're like, all right, cool, maybe you, like, give yourself a bit of a thumbs up for like three seconds and then it's on to the next thing and onto the next thing. And the hedonic treadmill of, like, goal achievement. And it's all fun. We can enjoy the journey along the way, but the hustling ness means that we have a tendency to not celebrate the wins. At least I do. I don't know about you. And so celebrating wins is a key way of keeping up the connection and relationship that we have with ourselves. And. And also apparently, according to TJ of boosting our oxytocin levels. Obviously there's all the room for constructive criticism and negative feedback and all that kind of stuff. But generally we want that voice in our head to be kinder to ourselves and to celebrate our own wins. Whereas we are often the most mean people to Ourselves, like the way that you probably talk to yourself. You wouldn't talk to any of your friends like that because they wouldn't be friends with you anymore. But we talk to ourselves in that way. And so focusing on celebrating more wins and giving ourselves a pat on the back, you know, that kind of thing is just a nice way of nudging our brain towards speaking to ourselves in a more positive fashion. The best thing I can recommend is when you are just about to fall asleep as your last thing at night, you've had your entire day, you simply review your day and you think, what is my primary achievement? It really is important to understand this doesn't need to be a massive thing. And then finally we come to action number five, which is thoughts of gratitude. Now, this is another way to boost oxytocin by working on being kinder to ourselves. Because when you connect with other humans, it does create oxytocin. But we also all have the capacity to connect with ourselves. And when you go into this, a lot of us do really struggle with the relationship we have with ourselves. Some of us are super critical of ourself. In our mind, some people like really tough. They're really judgmental of their appearance, success, whatever it might be. So it's again, the point around this negative voice in our heads we have. We make these negative comparisons with where we are compared to where we want to be or where we are compared to other people around us. And whenever we make those negative comparisons, we are essentially causing ourselves unhappiness. And the opposite of this is gratitude, when we can express and feel and think gratitude for the things that we already have in our lives. And actually, there was a study I read a few years ago. I can't remember where it was, but it's found that just doing date 5 minutes of gratitude journaling every day, just like writing down things that you're grateful for, had the same impact on your levels of happiness as doubling your salary. So think about your salary, think about how happy you feel if it was doubled. And I think that you can probably have that same effect. According to the study, I don't know how replicable it was, but you get the idea. You can probably have that same effect by just writing down things that you're grateful for. This gratitude journaling is something that I weave into any sort of journaling that I do. I have a sort of morning manifesto, which is a morning thing that I do as part of my productivity system. And part of that is like, what am I grateful for? Which is always a nice thing. And one thing that I've been trying to do again on TJ's recommendation is when I'm brushing my teeth for two minutes, I can habit stack that with thinking grateful thoughts. Apply. Oh, I'm grateful for the cup of coffee I've just had. I'm grateful for the fact I'm about to have a shower. I'm grateful for the fact that I have a roof over my head. All of that kind of fun stuff that's a lot easier to do when you pair it with an existing habit, like brushing your teeth, so you might find that to be interesting as well. All right, so I hope you enjoyed that little look into the chemical oxytocin. And if you'd like to see the other videos in the series about dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, you can find them in a little playlist just for you over here. Thank you so much for watching.

This video explores oxytocin, the ""love hormone,"" and its role in fostering human connection, confidence, and happiness. Neuroscientist TJ Power explains how oxytocin drives bonding and fulfillment. Five actionable strategies to boost oxytocin are discussed: acts of kindness, physical touch (e.g., hugs), minimizing phone/social media use, celebrating personal wins, and practicing gratitude. The video also highlights how technology disrupts oxytocin release and promotes Productivity Lab, a community-driven platform for focused work.  

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:46] Oxytocin is known as the love hormone**  
Oxytocin is a brain chemical critical for human connection, relationships, and self-confidence. Neuroscientist TJ Power describes it as foundational to love, family bonds, and overall fulfillment. High oxytocin levels correlate with calmness, confidence, and happiness. The video introduces a four-part series on brain chemicals, focusing here on oxytocin and five methods to enhance it.  

**[01:46-05:22] Five actions to increase oxytocin that make us happier overall**  
The first action—acts of kindness—is rooted in a 2007 study showing oxytocin increases generosity by 80%. Generosity creates a feedback loop, boosting social bonds and oxytocin. Examples include small gestures like making tea for coworkers, which uplift both giver and receiver. The ""Friends"" episode with Phoebe illustrates the impossibility of truly selfless acts, as kindness inherently rewards the giver. Daily reflection questions (""How can I make someone happy today?"" and ""What contribution did I make?"") are suggested to reinforce this habit.  

**[05:22-08:18] This video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab**  
Productivity Lab, a sponsored productivity platform, is introduced as a solution for remote workers struggling with focus. It offers virtual coworking sessions, accountability workshops, and community support, likened to ""CrossFit for productivity."" Users report increased output (e.g., launching YouTube channels or apps). The link between group activities (singing, exercising) and oxytocin is implied, positioning Productivity Lab as a tool to enhance both productivity and social connection.  

**[08:18-10:33] Our phones and social media stop oxytocin levels from rising in our brain**  
Phones and social media harm oxytocin via three mechanisms: fostering individualism (e.g., self-focused scrolling), increasing loneliness (by superficially satisfying connection needs), and hindering real-world interaction (reducing eye contact and active listening). The ""eyes and ears"" technique—prioritizing eye contact and undivided attention—is recommended to counteract these effects. Notifications are flagged as distractions that undermine meaningful conversations.  

**[10:33-13:35] Action number four is to celebrate the wins. And this has two big, big impacts on us**  
Celebrating wins improves self-talk and confidence while enhancing future success. High achievers often neglect this, perpetuating a ""hedonic treadmill"" of goal-chasing. Bill Perkins (author of *Die With Zero*) advocates nightly reflection on one daily achievement, no matter how small. This practice strengthens self-connection and oxytocin release by fostering self-kindness, countering harsh inner criticism.  

**[13:36-15:29] Another way to boost oxytocin is by being kinder to ourselves**  
Gratitude journaling—writing down things one is thankful for—boosts oxytocin and happiness, with studies comparing its effect to doubling one’s salary. Habit-stacking gratitude with routines like brushing teeth is suggested. Self-compassion is emphasized, as negative self-talk undermines oxytocin. By reframing comparisons through gratitude, individuals can improve their relationship with themselves and others.  

Key Points:  
- Oxytocin strengthens relationships, self-confidence, and fulfillment through acts of kindness, physical touch, and gratitude.  
- Phones and social media reduce oxytocin by promoting individualism, loneliness, and distracted interactions.  
- Celebrating small wins improves self-talk and sustains motivation, countering achievement-focused burnout.  
- Gratitude practices (e.g., journaling) significantly enhance happiness, comparable to major financial gains.  
- Community-driven tools like Productivity Lab leverage group dynamics to boost focus and connection.

Insight/Outlook:  
As society grapples with rising loneliness and digital overload, intentional oxytocin-boosting practices—like gratitude, kindness, and tech mindfulness—may become essential tools for fostering resilience and meaningful human connection."
audio_3.mp3,"If you've ever felt like there aren't enough hours in the day or that your to do list just keeps on getting longer no matter what you do, then this video is for you. In this video, we're going to go over the six components of the triage system, which is a method of time management that I learned during my eight years of medicine, first as a medical student and then as a doctor. It's the same system that I use today to manage my time, to run multiple businesses, to write books. And it's completely changed how I think about managing my time and my priorities. So when I worked as a doctor in the hospital, there was one key principle that changed how I thought about managing my time. And it wasn't about being more efficient or having more discipline or building better habits. It was about understanding the simple truth that the order in which you do things matters more than how many things you got done. So think about an emergency room. When patients come in, they are not seen on a first come, first serve basis. That would be absolutely catastrophic. Instead, the medical team uses a system called triage. They assess who needs attention most urgently. If someone is there with a heart attack, then they're going to get seen before someone who's there with a sprained ankle, even if the guy with the ankle got there first. But this is where it gets interesting, because in the emergency room, just like in life, the work never stops. There is always another patient coming in through the doors. There is always more that could be done. The to do list is infinitely long, and this is actually the reality that we're all facing today, because your to do list is never actually finished. There is always another email you could send. There is always another project you could start. There's always another skill you could learn. You could always be building your personal brand a bit more by writing more on LinkedIn and making a YouTube channel and all the stuff. The problem is not that we have too much to do. The problem is that we are trying to do everything. And this is the fundamental mistake that we all make with time management. We think that it is even theoretically possible to get on top of everything, to tick off all of the items on our to do list, when in reality, the mindset shift we want to have, and the one that completely changed everything for me, is to recognize that in a world where the to do list is literally infinitely long, it is physically impossible to get through the to do list. And therefore all we can do is what doctors in the emergency room do every single day, which is triage. We've got to make sure that fundamentally we are tackling things in order of priority and actually being okay if some stuff on the to do list just never gets done because it's not sufficiently important. And so now we're going to talk about the six core principles behind this triage method. These are principles that work together to help you not just get better at managing your time, but actually to make sure that what matters most is the stuff that actually gets done. So when I was in medical school and I first started my placements in the hospitals, there was one thing that I noticed pretty early on that was quite surprising, which is that every single doctor seemed to walk around with a folded piece of paper in their pockets, and they seemed to be writing things and scrolling things on that folded piece of paper and using that as their daily to do list. And then at the end of the day, they would take that folded piece of paper that had their daily to do list, they would stick it in the shredder machine type thingy because they couldn't carry it home because of patient confidentiality. And then the following day, they would take a blank piece of A4 paper from the printer in the hospital, and that would become their to do list for the next day. Completely fresh. Even back then, and this was like, 10 years ago, I was a productivity enthusiast. And so I thought, like, surely doctors around the world have found a better way of managing their tasks rather than just this blank piece of paper that they just sort of refresh every single day. And so I remember at the time asking one of the doctors that I was working with, why do you guys use this, like, paper manual system? Why not use an electronic system or use the electronic patient records where you can keep track of all the tasks that have to be done for all the patients? And she pulled out this piece of paper that had all of these, like, scrollings and markings off on it. And everything. And what she said was partly that the messiness of the to do list was the point, because every single time you cross something out, every single time you write something down, you're making a conscious choice about, is this thing sufficiently important for me to do or action today? Over time, I realized this is actually really powerful. And this is where the idea of the daily reset comes in, which is that every single day you are working off a fresh piece of paper. Rather than having all of your infinite different tasks on a to do list, where you're just being overwhelmed by, like, the incredible number of things that you have to do, it's still Important to have one of those like master task managers or product lists or to do lists or whatever so that you don't forget stuff. But the idea behind the daily reset is that every single day you are asking yourself afresh, what are the most important things for me to do today? The way that I do this in my life these days is something that I call the Morning Manifesto. This is a three to five minute journaling little prompt thing that I try my best to do every morning. This is what it looks like it is in my life. OS action, Google Doc. And it's got three components, prime, remind and plan. So prime let's connect to a body and prime our day with gratitude. Remind, let's remind ourselves of our key priorities. So what were our quarterly quests and how are they going? More details in that video up there. It'll be linked down below as well about what the hell a quarterly quest is. I ask myself, what were our top three outcomes for the week and how are they going? This helps with prioritization. And then within plan, I ask myself the question of what is today's adventure I. E. Single most important task going to be and is it in the calendar? And so this is one of the steps in my daily reset where every single day I'm asking myself, what is today's highest priority item that I need to get done? Sometimes I didn't manage to do the thing yesterday, and so the thing might carry over to today, but then again it might not. Part of the triage system is recognizing that it's. It's physically impossible to get through everything on your to do list. Therefore, we just got to focus on what are the most important things. And this is one of those questions that helps us figure out what is that most important thing. I also ask myself that if we have time, what other one to three tasks will we complete today? Others written down somewhere easily accessible, for example, an index card or the today view of our to do list app, et cetera. And this is where I use a pen and paper system. I take a fresh sheet on my little journal type thing and I write down physically by hand what specific tasks I want to get done today. And I try and limit myself to just three things. So I have my one most important thing and then I have one, two or three different extra tasks that I could do in addition to that. And those are written down on a piece of paper, by the way, if you're interested in how this entire system works together. This is all part of Life os, which is my personal productivity system that'll be linked down below. Now, speaking of things that I learned in medical school, another thing that I discovered is the importance of mental well being. And one way to improve your mental health and wellbeing is through therapy provided by BetterHelp, who are the very kind paid partners of this video.

The Handwritten box method for to do List management. Now this is the method that most doctors that I met were following to do their to do lists. And this is the method that I still use for my to do list many years later. Even though I'm not a doctor anymore, it's still really, really helpful as an entrepreneur, as a creator. And so this is how it works. Basically the idea is you create a box every time you have a new to do. Nothing particularly fancy about that in my case. These are three of the things I need to do today. So book Valentine's Day dinner for me and my wife to film this time management video and to apply for my Hong Kong id. Now in a traditional checklist, once you've done with the task, you would put a little tick in the little box. But what I noticed when I was working in medicine is that doctors never really ticked the box off. Instead, they did something a little bit more sophisticated, which is they had different levels of what happened to the box based on what the status of that particular task was. So there's a few different statuses that something could have. It could have this, where you've kind of made a start on the task, but there's still quite a lot of stuff to do. So, for example, if you needed to do a blood test on a patient, you might use the diagonal line to indicate that you've requested the phlebotomist to take the blood. Then when you saw that the blood was taken and had been sent off to the lab, you would half shade in the box, which shows that the task is 50% done or whatever. And then a few hours later, when the blood test is back from the lab and you have checked the blood test result and acknowledged it and acted on it, you would fill it in and then you would cross the thing out. And so this becomes a very nice way of not having to remember what the status of specific tasks is, but just having it straight on the piece of paper. In my case, what it looks like. For example, for filming this video, I would do the diagonal line thing. Once I have finished filming the video. I would half shade it in when I have got the footage onto my computer and set it to upload to Google Drive, and then I would fully shade it in and cross it out when it's been uploaded to Google Drive and now it's gone to my team and it's not my problem anymore, so I can safely forget about this particular, particular task. Depending on what you're doing with your work in your life, your status system might be different depending on what the task is, obviously. But I find this to be a very useful and also very satisfying way of managing a to do list. One of the core principles I learned around, like, what motivates us when I was doing research for my book, Feel Good Productivity, is that we feel really good at taking things off a to do list, right? Everyone's had that experience. Like, the experience of making progress on a task feels good. The problem is if you're only allowed to tick it off once you've completed the whole thing, the thing might have multiple steps here. With this method, you get the benefit of being able to see straight up what the status of a task is, but you also get that little doping mean hit of Being able to move that status of that task forward, even if you haven't fully completed it just yet. Back when I was a doctor, I did not have the luxury of only ever having three things on the to do list. I would have like dozens and dozens and dozens of things. Each time a new page or whatever would come in from a nurse, I would have to add a new task to the list. But then managing this infinitely long list of tasks, that is when we get onto component number three, real time triage. And this is really the crux of this time management method. It's really about recognizing, as we said at the start, that the to do list is always going to be infinitely long. You can never get through all of it. And so your job as a competent professional, whatever profession you're in, whatever you're doing in your work or your life, is to focus on triage. That is to do the most important, highest priority things first. When you're a doctor, for example, you can have your enormous list of all the bloods you need to check and all the things that you have to do. But then if you get a crash call if a patient's having a heart attack or whatever, and you have to drop everything and sprint across the hospital if you're part of the crash team, to hopefully do something about that. And then while you're there, you're getting three different pages of on your pager. And so straight after dealing with a cardiac arrest situation, you find a phone, you ring up all the people, all the wards who paged you, you add new tasks to your to do list. And in every moment you are strategically re triaging, reprioritizing your to do list. Just because you wrote things down in a particular order doesn't mean that is the order they should be done. In fact, it probably isn't the order that they should be done. And this applies so much in life outside of medicine as well. Whatever we are doing, we are always faced with the choice of there is an infinite number of things we could be doing, but what is the next most important priority right now? Something like the Morning Manifesto helps with this because you define your most important priority for the day right at the start of the day. But then if you're a professional, you're gonna, you're gonna get some kind of inbound, you're gonna get slack messages coming in, you're gonna get emails, you might get a call from the boss. If you're running a team, you might find out some information that like, oh crap, we're having a personnel issue that requires my urgent input right now. And based on that, the theoretical to do list that you created at the start of the day might go out of the window. But that's okay because you are always focusing on the next most important thing. There is a danger here, which is to always think about what is the most urgent thing. So urgent and important are two different types of things in the world of productivity. There is this thing called the Eisenhower matrix that you may have come across and that is kind of getting at this idea that the stuff that is important and urgent you have to kind of do immediately. The stuff that is not important and not urgent you should probably just delete or ignore for now. The tricky thing with this is what do you do about the things that are important but not urgent? And what do you do about the things that are urgent but not important? And I think with these two categories is really where the skill of being a competent professional or someone who's good at managing their time priorities comes in. Because what I found in my life is that the truly important stuff is rarely urgent and the truly urgent stuff is rarely particularly important. This is of course, different than in medicine where you're often dealing with life and death. And so the urgent and important often do sometimes go together, but still not always. And one of the biggest needle movers I found for my own productivity is to recognize when I can ignore something that is urgent but not important for the sake of something that is important but not urgent. And this requires the ability to be okay with, with things dropping being okay with all of the different balls that you're juggling, some of them being dropped. This is what I love about Oliver bergman's writing in 4,000 weeks and meditation for Mortals, really good books, is that if we assume a world where there's all these infinite number of things we could be doing, and we also therefore assume that it's physically impossible to do everything on the list. It follows naturally that it's actually impossible to have it all. It's impossible to be executing at full on efficiency, productivity, creativity, across all of the different domains of our life. We are going to have to let some things go. We're going to have to embrace mediocrity and embrace imperfection in quite a lot of the different areas of our life if we want to make real meaningful progress in others. And so there may well be seasons of your life where you don't reply to every WhatsApp message or every email that comes in your way. There may be seasons of your life, you know, I'm about to be a parent where work takes a bit of a backseat because I want to be present with the family or whatever the thing might be. But in a world where we are trying to take everything off the to do list, trying to do all of the things that is the true recipe for overwhelm and anxiety and stress. And so coming back to this idea of real time triage, in every moment, we, we need to be asking ourselves, is this thing I'm about to do really the most important thing I could be doing right now? And in a world where you only did one or two things each day, but those one or two things that you did were the most important things for you to have done that day, you would make an enormous amount of progress in a whole year compared to that situation that a lot of us find ourselves in, where we tick off all these things on our to do list and we get to the end of the day and we think, hmm, I feel like I did a lot of stuff, but I don't feel like I made a lot of progress. We have a lot of movement, but not a lot of progress. And if you're working in medicine and you're doing all of the lower priority, urgent things that seem kind of urgent, but you're forgetting the important stuff that you really need to get done, you're going to get fired pretty quickly because that's not the job of a doctor. The job of a doctor is not to do everything on the to do list. The job of a doctor is to do the most important things on the to do list. And I would extend that to the job of us as professionals who are trying to make the most of our time, trying to be efficient, productive, trying to get stuff done, trying to achieve our goals. Our real goal as it relates to time management is not to try to do everything. That would be a recipe for failure. Our real goal is to make sure that we are prioritizing the most important things. Component number four, the ward round protocol. So there is something that happens in hospitals at the start of every day, which is that you do a ward round, I. E. You go around and you look at all of the different patients that you've got on your ward. And for each of these patients, you go to them, you talk to them, you look at the notes for the patient, you look at all the different vital signs and all the different, like, blood test results and do you have any medical conditions at all? And you figure out what is the next action step in the patient's plan that will move them forward in their trajectory to get them better and get them fundamentally out of hospital. How the hell does this apply if you are not a doctor? Well, the reason it applies if you're not a doctor is that we can use that same concept as it relates to our projects. And so this is the system that I use to keep track of my different projects. I use a to do list manager called Things 3, but you can use whatever app you want. Now, these are all of the different projects I'm working on in work and in life. I've got my primary quarterly quest for my life and for my work. My primary quarterly quest for life is the martial arts setup. And my primary quarterly quest for work is to make life os, which is my productivity course, an absolute banger. And you can see next to these, I have a little emoji. So green means it is on track. So yellow means it is off track with a plan. And red means it's off track without a plan. I do sometimes also use blue, which means it is on ice, which means I'm not focusing on this thing right now. It's just it's being stalled by something or other. This is a very useful thing to be keeping track of. It's like every quarter, every 90 days or whatever, we have a finite number of key projects that we want to move forward. I recommend having one primary quest. This is the quarterly quest, which is the one most important thing that you want to move forward in each quarter in work and in life. But then for all of the other projects, it's worth having a status to know, okay, how far along is this project and is it still relevant? I also like to make sure that I've always ordered my projects in order of priority. So actually these are my weekly review questions every week. So I did one this morning. Part of plan is have we updated our to do and project list? So quests and projects are arranged in priority order. Every project has a clear next action and every project has an up to date status. On track, off track with a plan, off track without a plan, and on ice. So each week and I did this this morning, for example, I look at this thing and I'll be like, all right, cool. Our quests and projects range in priority order. Okay, well, actually, you know what? The creator club thing is actually more important than the art thing for now. So let me just sort of like reorient that or whatever the thing might look like Operation don't Die. You know what? Actually that's, you know, right now. Baby supplies takes priority over that because I need to go to the local department store to pick up like some items with a baby that's due to arrive in a few months. And so I'm just sort of making sure I've ordered thing in priority order. Again, speaking to this idea that it's not about doing everything, it's about doing the right stuff in the right order of priority. And then crucially, the next thing is that every project has a clear next action. This is one of the things that I really learned when I was doing these ward rounds when I was working as a doctor and when I was a medical student, which is that every single day you want to be making a plan for the patient and continue is not allowed to be a plan. Like, I would often hear doctors complain about this. Like, if one of their colleagues wrote continue as the plan, they'd be like, oh, continue is not a plan. Continue is not a plan. Because every single day we need to make sure there is one action that we can take to help that patient progress on their journey. Similarly, we need a next action for every single project. So for my make Life os a banger, I've got my next action point, which is talk to Kaelyn regarding what needs to be done. And I've got a meeting with Kaelyn later today. Voice Pal. I've got a few different actions. Voice Pal is an app that me and my team have built to help make writing easier and more fun. So if you have lots of writing to do in your work or life, then then you might like to check it out. Company relocation. I've got wf, which means waiting for waiting for tsj, our accounting firm, to come back to us with some sort of plan for like relocating my business to Hong Kong. And it's totally okay for waiting for to be a next action step in medicine. It will often be sort of waiting for occupational therapist and physiotherapist input or waiting for nursing home to get back to us. But we have to write that as an action step because you're awaiting input from some other external service. It must be documented as part of the plan for baby supplies. My next action step is a trip to Sogo for my art adventure. My next action step is to actually draw something for creator club. My next action step is to post on socials for martial arts setup. I don't have a next action step, but it's all. It's basically there because I've booked my next few sessions of Muay Thai. And so the next action step is Sort of basically within this little stuff that I've got here, when I do events and stuff and people ask for my advice about how to manage their to do list or like projects or priorities or when I'm doing my course sessions, I see that almost no one does these two things. Almost no one has a status for each of their projects, and almost no one reliably has a clear next action step for each of their projects. If you just do those two things, just like color code it in terms of status with a traffic light system and make sure, as David Allen tells us in getting things done, that every single project has a next action step, you will be way better at managing your time than most people are. Because almost no one does these two very sensible things which doctors do as part of the wardround protocol, where you make sure you have checked the status of every single patient and you've made sure you have a next action step as part of their management plan. All right, so that brings us to component number five, which is intentional incompletion. This is a story I read about in my book. But basically, in my first week of being on the emergency department, I had a run in with one of the senior doctors because I was feeling a bit of a hero complex. I was like, you know what? I'm going to. I'm going to see all these patients. I'm going to. You know, I'm here as like a junior doctor, first year, first year out of medical school, and I'm going to. I'm going to save the day. And I saw my first patient and it took like an hour. And then I looked at the list and look, the waiting room, and it was absolutely teeming with patients. Like, it was completely full. And I was like, all right, cool. I'm going to be a bit more efficient with the next patient. And so I saw the next patient in like 50 minutes. I was like, yes. And then I looked at the waiting room and it was still completely full. And then I saw the next patient in like 50 minutes. And I looked at the waiting room and it was still completely full. And then it got to lunchtime, and I said to myself, you know, I'm not. I'm going to skip lunch because I want to make sure I can, like, get through these patients. Maybe I've been a little bit inefficient because it's like my first week here. And so, like, I'm just going to power through and I'm just going to see more patients. And I had a conversation with one of the consultants who was on call, whose job it was to sort of manage the junior doctors and make sure they were taking their breaks. And what he said to me at the time was that, you know, no one is going to die because you've taken a lunch break. The waiting room will always be full. The patients will always be there to see. It's more important for you as the doctor to be rested so that you can be on form for the other patients that you're seeing rather than burning yourself out because you're, like, choosing not to take a lunch break just because the waiting room is full. And this was something that in almost every single placement that I did when I was working as a doctor and even when I was a medical student, the consultants were always looking out for. Are the juniors taking enough of a break? Are they taking a lunch break? Are they. Are they. Are they taking a little coffee break? Are they leaving work at a reasonable hour? And so really, the skill you end up cultivating as a doctor is intentional imperfection. Recognizing that it is part of my job to take a break, even though there is still stuff to do. It is part of my job and part of my role to go home at some point in the evening even though there is still stuff to do. Again, comes back to our point that we made at the start. There's always going to be stuff to do. I find that this is something that a lot of my entrepreneur friends struggle with. My wife is also a creator and entrepreneur, and she really struggles with this. She gets it gets to 8pm she's been grinding at work all day. There's still stuff to do. And she's like, oh, but I feel like I haven't gotten through all of the things in my to do list. And I have to be like, izzy, come on. Like, when was the last time you felt like you actually got through everything on your to do list? She was like, basically never. And I was like, yeah, like, how about we start, like, winding down? How about we have some food, let's go out for dinner? You know, that kind of stuff. I kind of have to coax her through. I hope she won't mind me saying this. I'm sure she won't mind me saying this, but I have to kind of coax her through getting off the computer because she has this thing of, like, I need to make sure I get through the to do list. And so for me, after that first week in the emergency department was when I realized, oh, okay, it's okay to leave things unticked. Off and to leave some patients waiting to be seen so that I can go grab lunch so that I can grab a coffee. It's okay to hand over things to the evening team if there's truly stuff that's urgent and important that needs to be done overnight so that I can go home when it hits, it's 5, 6, 7pm, whatever. Whenever my shift is supposed to end, of course every now and then there's going to be like some life threatening emergency that means you stay stay around for an extra two or three hours. But for the most part, if that's happening all the time, that is just a recipe for burnout in whatever profession you're doing. And so we're going to end with component number six, which is the two for one hour rule. This is something that I learned from one of our professors in medical school where she had like an email newsletter that she would send to the medical students. And one of the things in it was a really good quote that I think about a lot, which is an hour before nine is worth two after five. I now think of this as the two for one hour rule. Like if you get up early and do something before work before 9am that actually gets you twice as much output as waiting till after work to do the thing. The thing with medicine and the thing with pretty much every kind of demanding job is that it's really hard to get home from work and not feel frazzled. There's lots of ways you can do that. Part of my book, Feel Good Productivity is about making your work energize and enjoyable so that you get home from the end of the day of work with energy left in the tank. But even then, even then, admittedly it's really hard to get home from work with energy left in the tank. I've heard this from so many sort of YouTubers as part of my YouTuber Academy and so many other people being like, I want to do the side hustle, I want to start a business, I want to start a YouTube channel, I want to write a book. But by the time I get home from work, I just don't have any energy and I just want to blob out and watch Netflix or whatever the thing might be. And so in those cases, I remember the advice from this medical school professor, which is an hour before nine is worth two after five. If something is truly important to you and it requires creative energy, it is a lot more effective to get it done before work rather than after work. So a lot of my YouTube videos that I made I would get up earlier and I would film the videos before work because I knew that that's how they would get done. When I was at work, I would actively volunteer for the later shifts. I would My favorite shift to do of all time when I was working as a doctor was 4pm until midnight. I would try my best to swap with my colleagues who had families and stuff because they didn't want that shift because they wanted to be there with their families. But I would love that shift, man. Start work at 4pm, finish at midnight. That means I've got the whole day where I can do my YouTube videos and do my business and stuff. And then I can drive to work at 3pm after having a nice leisurely lunch. And then I can work from 4pm to midnight and I can drive for an hour home until like 1am, sleep until like 10am and then from 10am to 3pm I've got that time to be able to work on my side hustles. I absolutely loved those shifts because I realized I just always had more energy before work compared to after work. And so that's the final component of this time management system. If you have something that's really important to you that you actually want to get done, think about doing it first thing in the morning rather than hoping you have the energy after work or after school or whatever the situation you're in. All right, so I hope you found this video useful. If you want to dive more into the concept of quarterly quests and how I do things like 90 day goal setting and make sure I actually achieve those goals, that'll be linked in the video right over there. Thank you so much for watching. Have a lovely day and I will see you hopefully in the next video. Bye.","80-317380: A key principle that changed how I thought about managing my time was triage

The video outlines a time management system inspired by medical triage, emphasizing prioritization over efficiency. The speaker, a former doctor, explains six principles: daily reset with a ""Morning Manifesto,"" the Handwritten Box Method for task tracking, real-time triage to reprioritize dynamically, the Ward Round Protocol for project management, intentional incompletion to avoid burnout, and the ""two-for-one hour rule"" for tackling high-energy tasks early. The system encourages focusing on high-impact tasks while accepting that some items will remain undone, supported by mental health advocacy through BetterHelp.

---

**Chapter Summaries:**  
**[00:00-05:17] A key principle that changed how I thought about managing my time was triage**  
The speaker introduces triage, a medical prioritization system, as a metaphor for time management. Unlike first-come-first-served approaches, triage requires assessing urgency and importance. The infinite nature of to-do lists means completion is impossible; instead, the focus should be on prioritizing critical tasks and accepting lower-priority items may never get done. This mindset shift avoids overwhelm and aligns with real-world emergency room practices.

**[05:17-06:27] One way to improve your mental health and wellbeing is through therapy provided by BetterHelp**  
A sponsored segment promoting BetterHelp, an online therapy platform. It highlights accessibility (30,000+ therapists), flexible communication (messaging/video calls), and suitability for both clinical issues and general life challenges. The speaker emphasizes mental health’s role in productivity and offers a discount for viewers.

**[06:27-13:14] The Handwritten box method for to do lists is incredibly useful as an entrepreneur**  
Doctors use handwritten to-do lists with symbols (diagonal lines, shading) to track task progress (e.g., ""requested,"" ""in progress,"" ""completed""). This method provides visual clarity and incremental dopamine hits, fostering motivation. The speaker adapts this for entrepreneurship, using a physical journal to limit daily tasks to 1–3 priorities, avoiding digital overload.

**[13:15-17:39] Every project has a clear next action and every project has an up to date status**  
Inspired by hospital ward rounds, projects should have defined next actions and statuses (e.g., ""on track,"" ""off track""). The speaker uses a traffic-light system (green/yellow/red) and tools like *Things 3* to organize quarterly goals. Weekly reviews ensure alignment with priorities, mirroring medical protocols where ""continue"" isn’t a valid plan—each step must advance progress.

**[17:39-20:29] Part five of intentional incompletion is intentional imperfection**  
A personal anecdote illustrates the necessity of taking breaks despite unfinished tasks. The speaker recounts a medical mentor’s advice: ""No one dies if you take lunch."" Applying this to entrepreneurship, intentional imperfection means accepting incomplete to-do lists to preserve energy and avoid burnout, even if it requires ""coaxing"" oneself to step away.

**[20:29-22:49] Part of Feel Good Productivity is about making your work energize and enjoyable**  
The ""two-for-one hour rule"" advises tackling high-priority, creative tasks early (e.g., before 9 AM) when energy is fresher. The speaker shares how filming YouTube videos before medical shifts or opting for late work hours maximized productivity. Aligning work with natural energy cycles ensures output quality and sustainability.

---

**Key Points:**  
- Time management requires triage: prioritize urgent/important tasks, not completion.  
- Track tasks visually (e.g., Handwritten Box Method) to maintain momentum and clarity.  
- Projects need clear next actions and status updates to avoid stagnation.  
- Intentional breaks and imperfection prevent burnout in endless workloads.  
- Schedule demanding tasks during peak energy times (e.g., mornings) for efficiency.  

**Tags:** time management, productivity, triage method, mental health, task prioritization  

**Insight/Outlook:** Embracing strategic imperfection and energy-aware scheduling can transform productivity from a source of stress into a sustainable, fulfilling practice."
audio_4.mp3,"Hey, friends. Welcome to the very first episode of Everyday AI, a new series where I'm documenting how I'm experimenting personally with various AI tools to boost my productivity, achieve my goals, and just generally make life a little bit easier. In this video, I'm going to do a general rundown of how I am personally using AI every day to save at least like 10 plus hours a week. And I'm going to be honest, if you are already an expert in using AI and you already know how to do the fancy stuff, and you're already deep in the AI rabbit hole, I don't think this video is going to be particularly helpful for you. But if you're a relative beginner to the AI stuff and you are not using AI absolutely every hour of every day in your job, I'm hoping that something in this video might spark an idea that helps you refine your own approach to AI. Final thing to say before we dive in is that my life as an entrepreneur and writer and YouTuber may not mirror yours exactly. But the ways that I've always found most helpful when learning any kind of tools, but in particular AI tools, is what I call cross context learning. Basically just looking over the shoulder of someone else who's in a different industry and seeing how they use AI and then being able to apply it to my own context. And so I'm hoping that by showing you exactly what my process looks like, you'll be able to cross context, apply the stuff into your own work and your own life. Use case number one, how I use AI to augment my writing every day. All right, so there's a couple of AI tools that I string together whenever I need to write anything. So in my case, I need to write my email newsletter. I need to write internal memos for the team. All of my YouTube videos are downstream of writing. All of our social media posts are downstream of writing. Now, broadly, I have a three step process for writing anything. Step one is that I speak into an app called VoicePal that I have built with my team. Secondly, the stuff from VoicePal then goes into either ChatGPT or Claude by Anthropic. And then phase three is that it usually goes from ChatGPT or Claude straight into Notion where I make any final edits that I need to do before the thing is able to be sent. So today I need to write my email newsletter and this is the process that I'm going through. I start off by opening VoicePal and as you can see, I've been using VoicePal for a very, very very, very long time. Since the 9th of December when we first started building the app. Now at this point, I can hit record or I can hit type. Type is what I would do if I just want to capture a thought to come back to later. But in this context, I'm going to hit record. Okay, so I want to do my email newsletter this week about. I want to do it about a technique that I've recently been thinking about for beating procrastination. And that technique is to go through the motions in the context of filming YouTube videos. I procrastinate a lot from hitting the record button for filming YouTube videos because there's all these like emotional and cognitive barriers that get in the way around, like, oh, is this video gonna be valid, valuable, is it good enough, et cetera, et cetera. But I found that going through the motions, I. E. Just like doing my hair and putting on my hoodie and getting the camera angle sorted, essentially sort of setting myself up for success on the thing makes the step, the next step of getting started with the task way easier. So it's like a very slow on ramp. All right, so that was phase one. I start off by rambling whatever I've got off the top of my head into the thing. Normally I don't actually do this sitting on my desk. Normally I will put in my AirPods, go for a walk and, and like do the stuff then. And that tends to be how I create the bulk of my content through like emails and stuff. And then the really cool thing is that VoicePal is asking me sensible follow up questions. So it's asking what specific emotional or cognitive barriers do you face when procrastinating on tasks? Can you share any personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the effectiveness of going through the motions? How do you think this technique of going through the motions can be applied to other common procrastination scenarios? I can also click on this button and it will ask me even more sensible follow up questions. For example, how do you measure the success of this technique in overcoming procrastination? It's a good question. What are some variations of this technique that could work for different types of tasks? How can this technique be adapted for group settings or collaborative projects? And then I can click any of these and then it will start recording for that particular one. Can you share any personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the effectiveness of going through the motions? Yes, I can actually. So until I just started telling myself, you know what, I'm just going to go through the motions. Great. So that is going to upload and then you can see it's added the. It's added what I've just said to the stream and now it's asking me even more follow up questions based on this. How do you think the concept of going through the motions can be applied to different areas of life beyond exercise and content creation? One of my philosophies on using AI tools is that the goal is not to get the AI to write the stuff because like, what's the point, right? Like what's the point? I could go on Claude or ChatGPT or whatever and I could say, hey, just write a newsletter for me. It sort of defeats the purpose, right? The purpose is for this to be a personal newsletter where I'm sharing what are genuinely my own thoughts. And so the reason I'm using AI to augment this is to help me pull stuff out of myself rather than to do the work for me. The kernel and the seed of the idea is coming from me, myself, and I'm only using the AI in a way to augment that. All right, I'm going to do one more. What specific emotional or cognitive barriers do you face when trying to start a task? And how do you think going through the motions can help address them for me personally? Okay, fantastic. So now we have created a stream out of these four thoughts. If I wanted to, I could now press the export button and I could create a draft of Life Notes. So let's see what this looks like straight up. This is actually using Claude 3.5 behind the scenes to do the writing. I don't like this either. Okay. So generally if I don't like the output, what I will do is I will hit copy to clipboard and now I can go on Claude, which is my favorite app for writing stuff. I have created a project for where is it for Live Notes. And then I can go on Claude and say let's turn this into an issue of Life Notes and let's see what Claude does. Eh, yeah, no, don't like it. It's. Oh, it's, it's, it's really over. Over indexing on like one format of newsletter that I once wrote. Okay, go away. Don't really like it. All right, let's try ChatGPT. I have a life notes project in chat GPT. Boom. You know what? Actually this is pretty good. So what I find useful is I almost always use Both Claude and ChatGPT and give them basically the same prompt Claude I have found to be, for the most part, 80% of the time, just better at writing. But the nice thing about ChatGPT is that ChatGPT has the memory function, so it actually knows a lot more about me than Claude does. And so maybe like 20% of the time, ChatGPT will just give me a better first draft compared to the thing that I've created with Claude. Cool. So what I will do, I feel like this is good enough for a first draft. I'm now just going to open up Notion, paste it into notion. So now I've got the thing and now I'm going to do my own edits on this because, for example, I don't really want the subheadings. There is one other thing I often try, which is that with VoicePal, what I can do is I can go into each stream and I can show the original transcript. So this has all of the ums and ahs and all of that kind of stuff, but then I can copy that stuff into, for example, Claude. You know, actually, this is good. This is pretty good. Let's just bang out the same thing in ChatGPT and just see which one is better. So I'm gonna create a new one within this project. Boom. This is also good. I like this. I prefer it compared to this one. Boom. I don't like. Simple but powerful. Yeah, it's a bit too. Yeah. So, okay, so this is actually not bad. Now this is what the process looks like most of the time. So we're starting off with the transcript and stuff from VoicePal, either exporting a draft straight into Notion from VoicePal, although usually I tend to use ChatGPT or Claude as like an interim, to be able to sort of like have a bit of a conversation with it back and forth, and then you can see when it goes into notion, there's actually quite a few edits that I've made that I've made to the whole thing. One mistake I've often seen people make with AI tools is, is that they sort of think that the output is just going to be amazing straight up. But you saw, like, in this example, I did like four or five different outputs. A few with Claude, a few with Claude project, a few with ChatGPT, ChatGPT project, even VoicePower directly. And for all of them, I was like, eh, eh, eh. Like it's fine, but it's not perfect. And sort of by doing these outputs a few different times, you come to one that's like 80% good. And then I shove it into Notion or whatever, text editor of choice, and then I go through and make the edits. And it's just this back and forth process. I've seen a lot of people think that like, oh my God, AI can just help me with with my writing. And they expect the process to take five seconds. It usually doesn't take five seconds. Previously, writing my newsletter would take me about two hours because I'd be typing everything up. Now it takes more like half an hour because I start off by speaking and then like with Voicepal, like throughout the week I can just sort of send in thoughts and then, you know, usually by the time I get to writing my newsletter, I've got at least some thoughts of stuff that I was capturing throughout the week and then it becomes a lot easier to make it happen. Oh, by the way, if you are enjoying this video so far and you might like to start your own business someday, then a great resource to use is Shopify, who are very kindly sponsoring this video.

So thank you so much to Shopify for powering our business and for sponsoring this video. So at this point we have this in our newsletter. As part of my newsletter I also have a section of my favorite things this week. I tend not to use AI for that. I tend to just write them. So for example, I would write something like, you know, sometimes you just write something like this and like AI can't write like this. If I must say, this is this is good writing. Well, it's already good writing, but it's, it's very, very me. It was quite fun. It was quite fun writing this little, little paragraph, fanboying about this Tim Ferriss Brandon Sanderson podcast interview. Sometimes, even, even though we're in the world of AI and even though I showed an example of like, you know, how I used voicepearl and Claude and stuff to write this newsletter, sometimes I have a clearer vision of what I want to say then typing it myself helps me kind of express myself in, in this sort of way. If I tried explaining this to ChatGPT or to VoicePal or to Claude or whatever, it would have, it would have lost some of the color. Like this is colorful and sometimes we just go for color. We don't go for like, I don't know, clarity of writing or whatever. The other thing that I use which I find AI very helpful for is notion AI because I can just do command J and I can say, suggest 10 subject lines for this email and let's see what it suggests. Oh, okay. How I tricked my brain into being more productive. You know what, let's go for that one. Why not? That's easy. Feb 6 How I tricked my brain into being more productive. Great. If I didn't have notion AI, copy that, go into Claude and say, generate 20 subject lines for this email, please. Oh, it's got how I trick my brain into being productive. So I find this sort of thing quite helpful. Just like copying and pasting stuff into Claude or ChatGPT and then being able to just riff on that. Okay, so that was a lot of how we use AI for writing. Again, there's like tons and tons of stuff. I've been doing this for years now with Claude, with ChatGPT. So if this is interesting, I would love to hear in the comments what is like, what more would you like to see? We do this a lot. We use AI for pretty much every aspect of our team's workflow and my personal life. But I would love to know what you guys find helpful because. So then we can make more videos in the series. So another major use case that we use AI for is for any sort of data analysis. So anytime there is a CSV or yeah, any kind of spreadsheet, I'm like, glorious. I can just give it to ChatGPT and or Claude and get it to analyze it. So for example, I can go into advanced Mode for the YouTube analytics like of the last 365 days of content and I can download a CSV file. Great. I'm just going to grab this. Where is it? Table data, shove it into Claude and say this is analytics data from my YouTube channel. I want you to analyze it and based on the data, suggest the next 10 videos I could make if I wanted to maximize views and subscriber growth. Let's see what it comes up with. So we've got the science of habit formation. Evidence based strategies that actually work. Okay. Seven high income skills that be valuable in 2026. Okay. I'm probably 25. How to build wealth in your 20s. A step by step guide. Oh, that's good. That will do well. The psychology of focus. How to 10x your concentration. Oh, that's a good title. Student side hustles that actually make money in 2025 with proof. Okay. How to learn any new skill faster. The science of rapid learning. Yep. Good video. Five common money mistakes students make and how to avoid them. Yeah, Easy. Evidence based time management. How top. Yup. Nice. How to turn your skills into six figure business. The science of motivation. Why most people fail to reach their goals. Actually these are all pretty good. Your top performing videos average around 35 minutes. Wow. Aim for 30 to 40 minute videos. Fair enough. Okay, here is a prompt that I quite like. You've given me a level one response. I want you to go deeper and give me a level two and three response. That's always a little fun thing to try with pretty much any prompt. Okay, interesting. Level three. Micro optimization. Oh. Title structure matrix. This is interesting. Oh, that's a nice video. How to make your first hundred thousand dollars in 2025. Five skills that make your rich in 2025. The science of success. Eh? How to build a six figure side hustle. Yep, that's nice. Evidence based study method actually. Yep, that's nice. How to build wealth while studying. Yep, that's nice. I might as well stay poor in 2026. The ultimate guide to financial freedom. Okay, interesting. Five high income skills to learn before 2026. Yep, that's nice. How to actually achieve your goals. Science based. Yeah, we've already done that. So a couple weeks ago me and my wife went to Taiwan for a our like babymoon which is apparently the final holiday you go on before you have a baby. Because we've got a baby coming in a few months. And so while we were in Taiwan I was actually using Claude as my personal tour guide. So this was kind of how I met how it. How it went. I am currently in this big square in Taipei in Taiwan and there is this Absolutely. There's these two identical looking, absolutely enormous buildings on either side of the square. Where am I? And what can you tell me about. Sounds like you're at Liberty Square, formerly known as Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Square. Yep, that was it. The National Theatre, National Concert Hall. Nice. That's interesting. Help me understand the whole like, semiconductor thing. Like, how did, how did Taiwan become like the home of semiconductors? Oh, that's a fascinating story that combines strategic planning, education and timing. Here's how Taiwan became the semiconductor powerhouse. Story begins in the 1970s. Why is creating semiconductors so difficult? And why. How on earth can it be the case that this single company controls 90% of the supply of semiconductors? That seems utterly, utterly bizarre considering how important semiconductors are in the world. Okay, I'm in this temple in Taipei and there are people who are throwing down these, what look to be stones or sticks or something. Yeah, they're picking up sticks and then they're throwing them onto the floor. What's going on here? Oh, you're seeing people use moon blocks. These are questions. This was like exactly what me and my wife were doing when we were in exploring Taiwan. It was like Claude was basically our own personal tour guide. Like any question that we had, we were like, you know, just speak directly into it, get a response, and then we were sort of reading it out to each other so that, you know, we, it was like, you know, a vibey way of like jointly having Claude be our tour guide while we were hanging out in Taiwan. Now ChatGPT also does work as a, as a, as a tour guide and I do use it for a lot of stuff. But to use ChatGPT as a tour guide. I am currently in Kowloon in Hong Kong. I want you to tell me some interesting things about Kowloon Station. So you hit the tick button and then you have to press the send button. And so it takes two clicks to be able to speak to it rather than one click. So that was two clicks. Right, so you, it transcribes first and then it, and then you press the button. Whereas with Claude you press the transcription button and it does it straight away. So just that elimination of friction is why I prefer Claude rather than chatgpt when I'm doing like this sort of casual search engineing like tour guiding. As I'm, as I'm going around chat, GPT does have its sort of real time feedback thing, but I don't really like it because it talks too slowly. Hey, ChatGPT, I'm currently thinking of cooking Something special for my wife for Valentine's Day. She really likes sushi, but she's currently pregnant, so she's not allowed to eat like raw fish. Can you help me come up with some variants of sushi? That's a lovely idea since Izzy loves sushi but can't have raw fish while pregnant. You can make pregnancy safe sushi with cooked ingredients, veggies and creative flavors. Here are some great options. Cooked and safe seafood, sushi, shrimp tempura. It's not bad. It's just. It just speaks a little bit too slowly. So I generally prefer to interact with these different tools. Well, where I speak to them and then they give me the response in text and then we just kind of go back and forth. But purely because of that slight extra friction of like the Double click on ChatGPT, that's why I prefer to use Claude. There's also perplexity that I've been experimenting with for like, search engine type stuff. But, you know, these are some of the ways that I use AI to save lots of time in my work and my life. All right, this video is getting insanely long, but if you're still here in the video, I hope you have found value from it. Again, please, I would love it if you could leave a comment down below and tell me what you liked about it and what you didn't like about it so that when I make more videos in this series, we can just make them as useful as possible. Thank you so much for watching and I will see you hopefully in the next video. Bye.","80-120432: This video shows how I use AI to augment my writing every day

877100-1105076: How Taiwan became the home of semiconductors is fascinating story","Summary:  
The video introduces a series on using AI tools to boost productivity, focusing on the creator's daily workflow. It demonstrates using VoicePal, ChatGPT, and Claude for writing, overcoming procrastination, data analysis, and travel planning. The creator emphasizes cross-context learning, showing how AI streamlines tasks like drafting newsletters, generating video ideas, and acting as a virtual tour guide. Shopify is highlighted as a commerce tool for entrepreneurs. The video targets AI beginners, encouraging iterative AI use while maintaining personal input.

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-02:00] This video shows how I use AI to augment my writing every day**  
The creator introduces the series, explaining how AI tools save 10+ hours weekly. He outlines a three-step writing process: brainstorming via VoicePal (his app), refining drafts with ChatGPT/Claude, and finalizing in Notion. The goal is to extract ideas from himself, not fully automate writing. He demonstrates drafting a newsletter on overcoming procrastination by ""going through the motions,"" using VoicePal’s follow-up questions to flesh out thoughts.  

**[02:00-04:29] VoicePal uses AI to help you overcome procrastination**  
VoicePal’s workflow is detailed: the app prompts users with questions to deepen content (e.g., personal anecdotes about procrastination barriers). The creator records voice memos during walks, then exports transcripts to Claude/ChatGPT for drafting. He critiques outputs, preferring Claude for quality but using ChatGPT for context-aware suggestions. Iteration is key—multiple AI drafts are edited manually in Notion, reducing newsletter time from 2 hours to 30 minutes.  

**[04:29-08:41] Using AI tools can help you overcome cognitive barriers when starting a task**  
The creator discusses using AI for idea generation beyond writing. For YouTube analytics, he uploads CSV data to Claude, requesting video ideas to maximize views. The AI suggests titles like ""The Science of Rapid Learning"" and advises video length optimization. He also shares using ChatGPT for newsletter subject lines, favoring Notion AI’s integration for quick edits.  

**[08:41-09:42] Shopify is a wonderful commerce platform that allows you to start and grow a business**  
A sponsored segment praises Shopify for simplifying e-commerce, highlighting its integrations with social platforms and use cases (e.g., selling stationery, courses). The creator promotes a free trial link, emphasizing its role in his business.  

**[09:42-13:28] We use AI for pretty much every aspect of our workflow and my personal life**  
Claude acts as a real-time tour guide in Taiwan, answering questions about landmarks (e.g., Liberty Square) and cultural practices (moon blocks). The creator compares Claude’s frictionless voice-to-text with ChatGPT’s slower response, favoring Claude for travel. He also uses AI for pregnancy-safe sushi recipes, noting preference for text-based interactions.  

**[13:28-14:36] Okay, here is a prompt that I quite like. Five high income skills to learn before 2026**  
Claude generates video ideas like ""Five High-Income Skills to Learn Before 2026,"" with tiered prompts for deeper analysis (e.g., ""micro-optimization"" strategies). The creator emphasizes iterative prompting to refine AI outputs.  

**[14:36-18:25] How Taiwan became the home of semiconductors is fascinating story**  
A Taiwan travel anecdote transitions into explaining TSMC’s rise via Claude. The AI details Taiwan’s 1970s strategic investments in tech education and manufacturing, positioning it as a semiconductor leader. The creator contrasts ChatGPT and Claude’s usability for real-time queries.  

Key Points:  
- AI tools like VoicePal, Claude, and ChatGPT streamline writing by combining voice memos, iterative drafting, and manual editing.  
- Cross-context learning (e.g., using AI for analytics, travel, or cooking) maximizes productivity across personal and professional tasks.  
- Iteration is critical—AI outputs often require multiple attempts and human refinement.  
- Reducing friction in AI interactions (e.g., Claude’s one-click voice input) enhances real-time utility.

Insight/Outlook:  
As AI tools evolve, their integration into daily workflows will increasingly prioritize seamless interaction and context-aware adaptability, empowering users to focus on creativity over manual processes."
audio_5.mp3,"So when it comes to building muscle, the three most important things we need to do are, firstly, progressively overload in the gym, secondly, eat enough calories and protein, thirdly, we need to prioritize our sleep and recovery. Now this sounds pretty straightforward when you put it like that, but it's actually really hard to do in practice. And that's why in this video I wanted to dive into, firstly, why you should even care about building muscle in the first place, and secondly, how to actually build muscle in an efficient and evidence based way. And then along the way, I'm going to share some of the top resources that have helped me personally on my own journey to trying to get a little bit more jacked. Now, if you're new here, hi, my name is Ali. I am a doctor turned entrepreneur and author. And this video is part of Health Club, which is our ongoing series on this channel where firstly, I try and learn about how to live longer and healthier. Secondly, I try to actually apply those insights to my own life. And thirdly, I make videos like this one, sharing what I've learned in the hope that you might find something in here helpful as well. Even though I trained and worked as a doctor, the topic of how to build muscle was completely outside the scope of what we learned in med school. And so I reached out to a friend of mine, Steve Camp, who's the founder of Nerd Fitness, to help with the research for this video. And I actually first discovered Nerd fitness when I was around 17 years old when I first started started to try to get into this health and fitness stuff. It's an amazing resource. They've got tons of blog posts and guides and articles around fitness and nutrition and sleep and like all of the fun stuff. And so I want to give a big shout out to their team for helping with the research and the fact checking for the stuff that I'm going to say in this video. Part 1. Why should you bother building muscle in the first place? Okay, so a lot of people think that building muscle is something that you only do for vanity and aesthetic reasons. But building muscle is not just about this. And the most important why that we need to have for building muscle is that building muscle is very good for our health in general. Now in Peter Attia's book Outlive, which is a fantastic book about how to live longer and healthier, he describes exercise as the most powerful longevity drug. And he talks about how exercise increases both the length and also the quality of your life. In the book he writes, I think of strength training as A form of retirement saving. Just as we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the rest of our lives, we want to reach older age with enough of a reserve of muscle and bone density to protect us from injury and allow us to continue to pursue the activities that we enjoy. Now. The problem is that it's a lot easier to lose muscle than it is to gain muscle. And our muscle mass starts to decrease by default as early as our 30s, which is actually kind of scary. But having strong muscles that we've built up over time can help us move better. It can help us stay balanced and upright, which reduces the risk of falling, because if you fall when you're old, you can break your hip, and that basically ruins your quality of life. It helps you lift heavy things, which doesn't necessarily just mean barbells at the gym. It could mean that as you get older, you'll actually be independent enough to lift your own shopping bags and to be able to take stuff up and down the stairs. And it also helps slow down decreases in our bone density that happen over time. Now, the idea that Peter Attia talks about in his book, which I think is really, really cool, is the idea of the centenarian decathlon. So imagine, like, let's say you live to be 100. What are the sorts of activities you would love to be doing as a 100-year-old? Would you like to be able to walk up and down the stairs by yourself? Probably. Would you like to be able to lift your grandchild up in the air? That would be cool. Would you like to lift up your own shopping bags? Sure, why not? Would you like to be able to walk on your own to the local bus stop or to whatever, the train station, without getting out of breath and becoming comatose? You'd probably want to do that. This is the idea of the centenarian decathlon. Like, what is that series of things that you think you'd like to do in your old age? And then the idea is that once you know that, we kind of have to work back from that to figure out, okay, cool. So therefore, how much muscle mass do we need to have when we're in our 40s? How much cardiovascular fitness do we want to be aiming for when we're 50, so that when we're 80, 90, 100, we can still be relatively independent? And this was the thing that really sort of sealed the deal for me in terms of building muscle. Initially, the reason I wanted to build muscle was so I could get a bit more jacked and I don't know, become more attractive to women. But I'm married now, so that's less of a concern. But back when I was working as a doctor, I spent four months on a placement in geriatric medicine, which is sort of the care for the elderly ward. And there were loads of people there who were old and frail and they didn't really have much of a quality of life. They weren't very independent, they had to go into a care home. And a lot of this stuff could have been avoided with certain lifestyle factors. Like if someone was overly obese, they're way more likely to have a terrible time when they're older. If someone was very frail and they had a fall and they were to break their hip or whatever, then suddenly your quality of life takes an absolute nosedive and your chances of dying in the following year rise by an insane amount. And so the thing that I took away from working on that elderly care ward and reading about the centenarian decathlon stuff is that actually, you know, building muscle, it's not really for right now because, like, I don't know, me getting an extra few kg on my bench press isn't really going to change my life right now. What it will do is that it builds the habit of doing weight and resistance training, which has been shown in all sorts of studies to be really, really, really good for you. And B, it means that as I get older, I'm hopefully going to lose less of my kind of independence and ability to do stuff than I would have otherwise. The second reason to build muscle is that, especially if you're a dude, having a reasonably muscular physique does make you more attractive to women on average. And we're going to do a really fun experiment here. This is from a blog post by a chap called Julian Shapiro. I'm going to show you these two images. This is picture A and this is picture B. Now, the question is, which of these two physiques do you think is more attractive to women on average? Whatever sex or gender you happen to be, I'd love to hear in the comments down below what you think. But this is what Julian wrote in his blog post. Many women describe men with huge physiques as similar to girls wearing too much makeup. It is too much of a good thing. So apparently, on average, women actually prefer this sort of physique, which, you know, reasonably muscular, but not like, overly so compared to this guy who's, like, way more jacked and is the sort of model that you'd see on, like, male fitness magazines and stuff. The point being that yes, being and looking fit and healthy does make you more attractive to women, but you don't need to go overboard on it. And so you actually don't need to do that much in the gym to get a physique that most women would would find reasonably attractive. And finally, the third reason why you should probably have a decent workout routine and aim to build muscle is that it really does help with self esteem and confidence. Not because you're suddenly getting jacked, but actually because you've set this big long term goal for yourself. You're showing up consistently, you're making small progress over time, and you're experiencing the wins that you get from being able to progressively overload and lift a bit more weight than you could before. And it's also a great way to release endorphins, which are the feel good hormones you get by physically pushing your body.

Part 2 How to actually Build Muscle Key Principle Number 1 Progressive Overload okay, so progressive overload is basically a Fancy way of saying that over time you want to be lifting heavier and heavier weights. There are two apps that I personally use when it comes to progressive overload at the gym. The first One is the 531 app, which is just an app that someone's made that helps you just easily follow the 531 plan. So when I go to the gym, I look at the 531app and I'm like, all right, cool, what exercise am I doing today? And it just tells me exactly what weight and what reps I should be aiming for. So yesterday, for example, I had a bench press day. I used the Five3One app to tell me that, okay, cool. After a few warm up sets, I'm doing five reps at 60 kg and then three reps at 70 kg and then as many reps as possible at 75 kg. And that's how the 531 kind of workout plan works. Your working set, you're trying to do as many reps as you possibly can with that particular weight. And secondly, I use a really good app called Strong, which is an app that I've been using for years to log most of my workouts. But then the nice thing about Strong is that I can put bench press barbell into strong. And I could see that, okay, last time like three weeks ago I did seven reps at 75kg and so today I'm going to aim for more than seven. And I was like trying to aim for 10, but sort of when I got to seven, I was like, okay, I can't, I can't do 10. That's going to be, that's going to be too hard. But I managed to do eight. And then I broke a personal record because it's like, oh, before I only did seven reps at 75kg and today I did eight reps at 75kg. Great. That is progressive overload. It's where you're lifting a little bit more each time. But what's really helpful for that is to have some sort of log of what your workouts are because it's impossible to remember that, oh, you know, on the 12th, four weeks ago, last time I did this particular workout, this is the exact weight that I lifted and therefore this is what I should aim for next. I found that tracking my workouts helps make them feel like more of a game, feels like more of a, a fun thing that I'm doing, and also helps me set a particular goal. I did seven reps last time. I'm going to go for Eight reps today, that sort of thing. And there are four key factors that it's worth appreciating to help you maximize your chances of building muscle. There is volume, intensity, frequency, and specificity. Now, if you're a complete beginner to working out, or even if you're an intermediate to working out, you should probably just follow a plan that someone has come up with. I'm currently following the 531 method. I don't know who it's by. I read the book about it. It seemed legit. Or you could go to a personal trainer at the gym and just ask them to give you a plan. Pretty much every reasonable workout plan will have all of these fact has taken into account. But for me, I found it helpful to kind of understand a little bit of the theory behind it so that I Understood why the 5:3:1 plan works or why StrongList 5x5 works, or, you know, all of that fun stuff. So volume is basically the amount of work that you're doing. And in your workout, it's calculated by multiplying your sets by your repetitions or reps. So, for example, if you do three sets of squats each with 10 reps, then your total volume is 3 times 30, which is 30 working reps. Most experts say that for most of our exercises, we should be aiming for a rep range of five to 15, which means doing five repetitions is fine, and up to doing 15 repetitions is fine. When you get into like 25 and 30, that is also fine. But then it just takes ages and it sort of feels a lot more taxing on the body and stuff. So generally, 5 to 15 is what most people recommend. And ideally, if you want to maximize your gains for a single muscle group, like, let's say quads or hamstrings or biceps, we want to be aiming for six to 10 sets of per workout. And that could roughly translate to two to three different exercises. So let's say you're working on your quads. You could do three sets of squats, which would hit your quads. You could then do three sets of leg press, which would also hit the quads. And then you could also do three sets of leg extensions, which would be nine sets, hitting the quads in particular. Personally, I don't like to think too hard about this stuff because it gets. It gets kind of complicated. And people way smarter than you and me who specialize in gym bro stuff and who have spent their lives in the gym have just come up with exercise plans. So I think just following a plan is the way forward. But of course, it's useful to understand the theory as well, just in case you happen to be at a hotel gym where you can't quite follow your plan, it doesn't have the equipment. Then in that case, understanding the theory behind this stuff, you can then create your own workouts if you have to. But ideally you wouldn't have to. You would just follow someone's preexisting plan anyway. Secondly, intensity is the weight that you choose to lift. How much weight should you be lifting with each exercise? Well, follow the plan. But what most of the expert recommendations say is that you should be lifting to within one to three reps of failure while maintaining appropriately good form. So, for example, yesterday I did a bench press session, I was following the 5, 31 plan, and this basically means that you could technically and physically do one or two or three more reps of that exercise, but you choose not to. For example, you could do 12 squats at 70 kg, but you instead do 10 reps in a single set, which leaves 2 reps in reserves, or RIRS is sometimes used. And this would be a good level of intensity if you're trying to bicep curl this glass, for example. And you know, it would take me thousands of reps of this to get anywhere near failure, which is why I would need to increase the weight of whatever I'm bicep curling so that I can stay within the 5 to 15 rep range, but also having enough intensity that I'm only leaving one to three reps in reserve. Thirdly, we have frequency, which is how often you work out each week. Now, if you're trying to get the most bang for your buck in terms of muscle gain relative to time invested, most recommendations say around three to four workouts per week is best for most people. Some people go up to five. And if you're a complete beginner, you can probably drop down to two workouts per week and just do a full body workout each time. And that's because as a beginner, you don't need much of a training stimulus to make gains. You've got the beginner gains, the newbie gains, whatever people call them. In my case, I'm following the 5, 31 plan and I'm aiming for four workouts each week. Sometimes it's three, sometimes it's four. But like most weeks, I aim for four, and each workout ends up being somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes, depending on what exercise I'm doing. Like, if it's deadlift day, it takes ages to set up a deadlift. So it takes longer compared to overhead press, which takes a lot less time to set up for. The main thing here is what every single recommendation says is that consistency is one of the absolute most important things. You want to pick the workout routine, the workout regimen, the workout frequency that allows you to stay consistent, because consistency in the long term is what gives you results like everything in life. And then finally, we have specificity, which means choosing the most appropriate exercise to apply tension to the target muscle that you want to work on. Again, all of this is taken into account if you just follow a plan. Go on Google, go on Reddit, go on Nerd Fitness, go on Jeff Nippard's YouTube channel and buy one of his guides, which I bought a little while ago. It's really good. Just like, follow someone's plan and you won't have to think about this. But the point of specificity is that, you know, there are certain exercises that target certain muscle groups. But the main thing to take away from this section is that, yes, of course, we need to be consistent with our workouts and we need to hit the gym at least two times a week. But really, the key is progressive overload. Progressive overload is what makes muscles grow. You probably don't want to be doing the exact same workout every single time. You want to be increasing the weight or increasing the number of sets or increasing the number of reps over time so that your muscles become more and more taxed. And over time, you'll find yourself growing muscle. In the video description, the guys at Nerd Fitness have very kindly put together some example exercises and also some example workouts. And we'll put loads of links to all of the sources and all of the stuff in the video description as well. If you want to explore this rabbit hole a little bit further, Principle number two, eating well. Okay, so when it comes to building muscle, yes, genetics does play a certain part. You probably have friends who seem to be jacked without doing any work. And if you're like anything, like me, maybe you're South Asian, you struggle to get jacked even when you put in a lot of time in the gym. But according to the research, lifestyle factors matter a lot more than genetics when it comes to building muscle. And so these are things like how you train and your diet and your sleep and your stress levels and all that fun stuff. Now, when it comes to eating, there are two key things that we need to keep in mind. The first one is protein. So the question is, how much protein should you be having well, firstly, we need to have protein, because protein is literally the building block of muscle. It allows muscles to grow and to recover. But the problem is most of us don't get enough protein. Now, the current International Recommended Dietary Allowance, RDA guidelines for protein intake, says that you should be aiming for 0.8 grams of protein per kilograms of body weight per day. So in my case, I weigh around 75 kg. According to the guideline, I should be aiming for 75, 0.8, which is 60 grams of protein per day. Now, according to Peter Attia, who is a doctor and a scientist who has researched this stuff, he literally says in his book, this is a complete joke. This is way too little. I don't know why the Recommended Dietary Allowance is so low, but every fitness professional and person who studies this stuff that I've ever heard speak about this, and I've interviewed a bunch of them, have all said that that is just an absurdly low amount of protein if you're genuinely trying to build muscle. Now, if we ignore these international guidelines that apparently don't know what they're talking about, the actual recommended protein intake for people who are a healthy weight and trying to gain muscle is 1.6 to 2.4 grams of protein per kilograms of body weight per day, which is a lot more than you might think. So in my case, I'm 75 kg and using this recommendation, I should be aiming for 120 to 180 grams of protein every single day. That's actually weirdly hard to do. I've been tracking my protein now for a while using an app called Protein Pal. I sort of sometimes track macros using MyFitnessPal, but it gets a bit annoying. Maybe that's why I'm not as jacked as I could be, because I don't track properly, but it's just really hard to get enough protein. Like, how do you get 150 grams of protein per day? It's like, yes, you could have 50 grams of protein with three meals, but like, I have 50 grams of protein for breakfast. That's like, I don't know, a chicken breast and a half. Who has a chicken breast and a half for breakfast? It's just weirdly hard to do. I found the best thing is to just aim to have a protein shake first thing in the morning, and then for lunch and dinner, to be aiming to get a decent slab of protein with whatever I'm eating and then aim for another protein shake in the afternoon, and that tends to get me up to the 150 grams per day. But it's weirdly hard to get enough protein if you're not getting muscle at the degree that you'd like. I've spoken to a bunch of people who specialize in this and are way more jacked than I am. A lot of it is down to are you working out in the gym consistently enough and are you eating enough protein? Those things seem to cover a wide majority of, like, the base of reasons why people struggle to gain muscle other than protein. The other important thing is calories. So you want to be make sure you're actually eating enough food overall. This is where things start to get complicated. Because in general, if you want to build muscle, you want to be in a calorie surplus, I. E. You want to be eating more calories than you're expending. The problem with that is, as you build muscle, because you've got progressive overload and a good training stimulus, you're also going to get a little bit fat. And this is a problem that loads people have. I've had this problem for years where I'm like, okay, I'm in a bulk phase and so I gain muscle and I'm making the gains, but then the belly gets bigger and I'm like, wait, why am I getting fat? Like, you know, this is not what I was promised. I'm not going to go into the details too much in this video. I've done so much reading about this, watched a bunch of videos about it. I'll put some of the links down in the video description. If you want to explain, explore this rabbit hole. And there are loads of people on YouTube who are way more qualified than I am to talk about the ins and outs of bulk versus cut cycles, or like, you know, or like lean gains while on maintenance calories and all that kind of fun stuff. But if you're a beginner and you're following a plan, hitting the gym three or four times a week consistently and eating enough protein, you're probably going to be good. You probably don't need to think too hard about the calories. But if you want, you can, and you can find more information about calories as a specific topic. And then we come to principle number three, which is resting. Well, now, one of the most important things to remember when it comes to building muscle is that our muscles are buil when we are eating and resting, not when we're actually at the gym. So firstly, let's talk about rest between sets during a workout. And the general rule with rest between sets is that you want it to be long enough that you can put in the same amount of effort into each set, and you want the rest to be long enough that you feel mentally ready to go again. And you're not limited by things like your heart rate or breathing rate if you're doing particularly high intensity exercise. So, for example, if you're warming up or you're working with a lower weight, then you might only need to rest for 60 to 90 seconds in between sets. But if you're lifting super heavy weights, then you might even need to be resting for three to five minutes between sets, which can sound like a really long time. Now, during that rest time, it's totally okay to not do anything. Often in my rest time at the gym, I'm just listening to a podcast or an audiobook or taking notes or something on my phone. In an ideal world, if I cared about really maximizing the efficiency of my muscle gain, I would be doing antagonistic exercises during the rest. So, for example, I could be doing overhead press, which works the shoulders, and then during my rest from overhead press, I could be doing squats, which works a different set of muscles. And so in a way, one set of muscles is resting while the other set of muscles is working. And that just makes your time at the gym way more efficient. The second important part of rest as it relates to building muscle is about sleep. And there have been a bunch of studies that have shown that not getting enough sleep actually shifts your body towards catabolism, which is a state that favors the breakdown of muscle, rather than anabolism, which is the state that favors the building up of muscle. So if we care about building muscle, we really should be trying to get enough high quality sleep, which will really help with that process. And if you're interested in learning more about that, you can check out this video, which is also part of a health club series where I do a deep dive into the science behind how to get better sleep. Thank you for watching. Hope you found this useful and I'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye.","80-75910: This video focuses on how to build muscle in an efficient and evidence based way

### Chapter Summaries:  

**[00:00-01:15] This video focuses on how to build muscle in an efficient and evidence-based way**  
Ali introduces the video’s purpose: to explain why and how to build muscle effectively. He outlines the three pillars of muscle growth—progressive overload, nutrition (calories/protein), and recovery—while acknowledging the challenges of implementation. Ali introduces himself as a doctor-turned-entrepreneur and mentions collaborating with Nerd Fitness for research. He frames the video as part of his ""Health Club"" series, blending personal experimentation with evidence-based insights.  

**[01:16-05:55] Building muscle is very good for our health in general**  
Ali challenges the notion that muscle building is purely aesthetic, citing Peter Attia’s book *Outlive* to emphasize its role in longevity and quality of life. He discusses age-related muscle loss (starting in the 30s) and the ""centenarian decathlon"" concept—preparing physically to enjoy activities in old age. Ali shares anecdotes from his medical training in geriatrics, linking frailty in the elderly to preventable lifestyle factors. He also humorously addresses attractiveness and confidence benefits, referencing a blog post comparing women’s preferences for ""reasonably muscular"" vs. overly jacked physiques.  

**[05:55-07:03] Brilliant is an online education platform where you learn by doing rather than consuming**  
This chapter is a sponsored segment promoting Brilliant, an interactive learning platform. Ali praises its hands-on courses in math, programming, and AI, noting its use of problem-solving over passive consumption. He shares a personal endorsement (using it for five years) and offers viewers a 30-day free trial and discount via his referral link.  

**[07:03-13:40] There are four key factors that can help you maximize your chances of building muscle**  
Ali details the four pillars of effective training:  
1. **Volume** (sets × reps), aiming for 6–10 sets per muscle group.  
2. **Intensity** (lifting 1–3 reps shy of failure with good form).  
3. **Frequency** (3–4 weekly workouts for optimal gains).  
4. **Specificity** (choosing exercises that target desired muscles).  
He advocates following pre-made plans (e.g., 5/3/1 or StrongLifts 5x5) and using apps like *Strong* to track progress. Consistency and progressive overload are stressed as non-negotiable.  

**[13:40-17:27] Lifestyle factors matter more than genetics when it comes to building muscle**  
Ali dismisses genetics as a primary barrier, emphasizing lifestyle choices like training, diet, and sleep. He critiques the outdated RDA protein guideline (0.8g/kg) and recommends 1.6–2.4g/kg for muscle growth, sharing his struggle to hit 150g/day as a 75kg individual. Practical tips include protein shakes and calorie tracking. He briefly touches on bulking/cutting challenges and directs viewers to specialized resources for deeper dives.  

**[17:28-19:08] First, let's talk about rest between sets during a workout**  
Optimal rest periods (60–90 seconds for lighter sets, 3–5 minutes for heavy lifts) are explained, with tips like alternating antagonistic exercises (e.g., squats during overhead press rests) to save time. Ali also links sleep quality to muscle recovery, citing studies on catabolism (muscle breakdown) from poor sleep. He references a previous video on sleep science for further details.  

---

### Key Points:  
- Progressive overload (gradually increasing weight/reps) is critical for muscle growth.  
- Protein intake should be 1.6–2.4g/kg/day, far exceeding outdated guidelines.  
- Consistency in training (3–4 weekly sessions) and recovery (sleep, rest periods) outweigh genetic limitations.  
- Tracking workouts with apps like *Strong* enhances accountability and progress.  
- Muscle building is a long-term investment for healthspan and independence in old age.  

**Tags:** muscle building, evidence-based fitness, health longevity, workout routines, protein nutrition  

**Insight/Outlook:** Building muscle is less about short-term aesthetics and more about cultivating sustainable habits that enhance lifelong health, independence, and resilience against age-related decline."
audio_6.mp3,"All right, so I put out this poll on my YouTube community tab yesterday saying, if starting a business is something you'd like to do, what is stopping you? And we had 193 comments. The highest voted comment was from Gonzalo, who said, honestly, not having good ideas and fear of wasting time and money on a bad idea. I think what this comment speaks to is that there are various myths that people believe about starting a business. And in this video I would like to share my perspective on each of these different myths. Thank you so much, Adobe Express, for sponsoring this video. And by the way, if we haven't yet met, my name is Ali and I've been doing this online business thing for over 10 years. I built and sold my first six figure business while I was a medical student at Cambridge. I built my next business to six figures while working full time as a doctor. And a few years ago I was able to quit the day job to focus on the business, which now generates seven figures a year in profit and lets me live a life that I absolutely love. The key thing to remember with all of that stuff though is that this sort of journey to having a sort of multimillion dollar lifestyle business did not happen overnight. And there were loads and loads of failures along the way. And so this is the video that I wish I would have had when I was early on in my entrepreneurial journey. And let's start with myth number one. And the first myth that I would like to debunk for your consideration is that you need a good idea to start a business. This is actually a little bit of a myth. You don't really need a good idea to start a business. You just need any idea to start a business. One of my core beliefs as it relates to business is that for most people, your first three businesses are very likely to fail. And that is a good thing because those three failed businesses will teach you the skills of how to actually build a business. You learn business by creating a business and by attempting to make it work, rather than by watching loads of videos, watching loads of courses, attending business school, having a corporate job. These things, you know, they work to some degree, but they don't really teach you the nuts and bolts of how to actually build a business. It's sort of like riding a bike. You could read all the books you like about riding a bike, you could watch all the videos you want about riding a bike. But unless you actually sit on a bike and try and pedal and realize, oh, okay, you fall off a bunch of times and then eventually you Learn how to ride a bike. That is the only real way of learning how to ride a bike. It's the same thing in business. There is this misconception that you need to have a good idea to get started, that the bar for an idea is here. But there's a good quote that I really like from entrepreneur James Altucher, which is that if you can't come up with 10 business ideas, forget about coming up with 10, and instead come up with 20 business ideas. Like, for example, you're watching this right now. I'm imagining if you're watching this video, that you actually want to start a business and there are various obstacles that are holding you back. And so if I were to ask you, hey, you know, what's your best business idea? You might be like, ah, I don't know, because, like, the bar is so high. But if I were to say, okay, your job in the next 10 minutes is to come up with 50 business ideas, suddenly the bar gets lower and lower. You might think, oh, my goodness, I couldn't possibly come up with 50 business ideas in five minutes, whatever the thing might be. But if we imagine a thought experiment, if you had a gun to your head, had to come up with 50 business ideas, they could be as bad as you wanted them to be. You just had to come up with 50 of them in the next 10 minutes. You'd probably find a way to come up with 50 business ideas. All that matters is that we've reduced the bar for quality, the bar for what is a good idea. Because in a world where we know that our first three businesses are probably gonna fail, we don't really need to start off with a good idea. In fact, it's probably best to not start with good idea, because you can save that for when you actually know the skill of starting a business. Now, at the point where you have some business ideas to share, then you might like to check out this completely free business planning template that I've created in partnership with the wonderful team at Adobe Express who are kindly sponsoring this video. And you can check out this template completely free by clicking on the link in the video description. And this template walks you through the kind of stuff that I would personally recommend you think about as it relates to starting your own business. So we've got this slide, which is the basic business idea template, and you can duplicate this multiple times for various different business ideas. We're focusing on step one, who is the target customer for the business? Step two, what problem is your business solving? And step three, where are you going to find 10 target customers to potentially pay you for your business idea. Once you've come up with a few business ideas using this format, you can then dive into the more detailed section of the template. So we've got this slide, which is specifically about the problem statement. We've got a few prompts around the solution. We've got a few prompts around the target market. And here I'm holding up Alex Hormozy's wonderful book, $100 million leads, which is also very, very good that you should read if you haven't read it already. We've got some prompts around your unfair advantage, like, what is it that gives you personally an edge in the space? And then when you're ready to take action, we've got this now not how slide, which is terminology from my friend Noah Kagan's wonderful book, Million Dollar Weekend. And that asks things like what is the fastest way to test if someone will pay for this? And what is the simplest version of the solution that you can test? For example, it might be something as simple as sending a WhatsApp message to 10 of my friends and asking if they'd be willing to pay $1 to try the service out. There is really something magical about getting that first customer, getting that first person to actually give you real money for the thing. And a common mistake people make is trying to make too much money right at the beginning. Again, your first three business ideas are probably going to fail, but they're probably going to fail because you haven't found a way to validate demand. And so we are really trying to optimize for speed here. What is the fastest way to test if someone will pay for this? There's also a very helpful slide here, which is the crystal ball method that I also talk about in my book. But the idea here is that you imagine it's three months from now. What are the top three reasons why this business that you're starting doesn't go to plan? And what actions can you take to mitigate against each of these risks? Then we have a slide for your distribution strategy, your annual goals as it relates to your business, using my GPS method, your quarterly quests. So an action plan you can make over the next 90 days. And then if you like, you can also use the weekly project part of the template to take action week on week. So let's start with the first business idea. And again, this is the sort of stuff that I would actually be thinking about if I were trying to start a new business in terms of coming up with a business idea. We want to start with a problem statement so people struggle with problem. My business idea is to help them buy. And we want to try and figure out like, okay, that is the format of a business idea. And what's interesting is you'll notice that people comes first. Step one is the who. I think a big mistake that people make when it comes to business ideas is that they focus on the what or the how rather than the who. But a business is not a business unless you've got customers that are willing to pay for it. And so that's why we start with the who. So for me, business idea number one might be a freelance video editing service. Now my people are, let's say, YouTubers. I'm going to say YouTubers struggle with editing, taking too much time. This is my problem. My business idea is to help them by offering an affordable, efficient video editing service so that they can focus on content creation. And the so that they can bit is also quite important here because it's not just about the feature, but it's also about the benefit it provides your customer. So fleshing this out a little bit, who's the target customer for this business idea? And so that might be small youtubers under 50k subs who want to grow but don't have time to edit their own videos. While the problem it's solving is the struggle of videos taking way too long to edit and eating up the time they could be spending making more content or just having a life outside of YouTube. And then where, where are we going to find 10 of these target customers to talk to about our business idea? And so that could be through reaching out to small YouTubers via DMs on Twitter or Instagram or email, or posting in YouTube related Facebook groups, or browsing r YouTubers on Reddit and offering free sample edits like whatever that thing might be. And this would be, for example, business idea number one. This example of a local dog walking service could be business idea number two. And this, for example, might be business idea number three, which is an Airbnb cleaning and management service. This template is based on the colors and the vibe of Feel Good Productivity, which is my book. But you can of course, like customize this template to your heart's desire based on your own vibe or your own branding or just your own creativity. For example, I could create a new brand kit which is a premium feature. I can then select whatever fonts I want and then I can hit Apply brand and it'll apply those brand guidelines to my template, if that's what I want to do. And if I wanted to, I could even use some of the generative AI features. So in this case, I could generate an image of happy dogs being walked by an enterprising young man. And here we go. We've got a nice cute image for our dog walking service. And so if you're using a template like this just for your own personal brainstorming, it's just kind of fun to have some images. But you can see the value of using something like Adobe Express if you're creating slideshows or pitch decks or brochures or anything like that. Anyway, if you want to use this Adobe Express template for your own business ideas, then check out the link below and you can use it completely for free. So thank you so much, Adobe Express, for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. Relatedly, Gonzalez point was also the fear of wasting time and money on a bad idea. And that relates to myth number two that I would love to offer for your consideration, which is that time spent on a business that fails is time wasted. This is actually a myth because, for example, it would be like saying, man, it was such a waste, waste of time. Those first few times I rode a bicycle because I fell off. What a waste of time. Oh my goodness, I never want to do that again. That's not how it works, right? The fact that you fell off the bike the first few times you tried, it was an investment of time that you needed to invest in order to learn the skills of riding said bike. And so really, I can understand where the fear comes from of like, oh my God, I've got a job already. I've got all these things to do, and I don't want to waste my time, I don't want to waste money, I don't want to waste effort. But every single thing that's an investment looks like a waste of time and effort and money at the start, especially if the outcome of that thing is particularly uncertain. And that's the thing with business. I think school teaches us to aim for certainty, like, hey, these are the things that you have to follow in order to get an A grade, or whatever the thing might be. If you get this number of requirements of A grades, then you're going to be able to get into a university. If you follow that curriculum at the university and tick these boxes, then will happen. And we grow up in this mindset of like, I will only do something if I have a certainty of the outcome on the other side. This is why Often parents will say things like, don't do a degree in music because, like, your chances of landing a job are a lot less. Why don't you do a degree in accounting and finance instead? Because your chances of landing a job in accounting and finance are greater. And unless you have particularly entrepreneurial parents, if your parents are entrepreneurs, they wouldn't be saying that at all. Most parents are not entrepreneurs. Most of the people around us are not entrepreneurs. And so the default water that we as fish swim in is the water of I must optimize for certainty. Now, there's an important caveat here in that there are some people in the world who do need to optimize for financial certainty and financial security. If, for example, you have bills to pay, you have a family to feed, you have a mortgage, etc. Etc. And you need the financial certainty and financial security in order to put bread on the table for your children in that world, it makes a lot of rational sense to optimize for certainty and financial security. And then maybe in that world, starting your own business might not necessarily make sense even in that world. To be honest, I would argue that, like, unless, for example, you're a doctor, where you can basically guarantee employment for your whole life, a lot of jobs are being disrupted. AI is sort of taking over a lot of things. You actually, I would argue in a lot of instances, would have more financial security if you start your own business and take your economic engine into your own hands rather than expecting it to be handed to you by an employer. But all that said, I understand that there is a world in which some people genuinely are optimizing for financial security. But the reason I'm saying this is because the thing that I see in a lot of people, I know, a lot of people I speak to and talk, a lot of my friends who want to start businesses, but who are afraid to start businesses, is that they are overestimating the degree of financial security they actually need. They're often not on the poverty line, where not making that next paycheck means that the kids are going to starve. They're often in a far more privileged situation than that, and yet they are operating from this place of like, oh my God, I need certainty, I need security. And again, it's usually not a money thing. It's usually there is some sort of emotional fear and scarcity underneath that desire to be financially secure. All of that said, it comes back to this myth that time spent on a business that fails is time wasted. It's a myth if we know that Our first three businesses are probably going to fail. My first six businesses failed before I built a business that was successful. But I needed those six failures to learn the ropes a little bit. I needed to fall off the bike a handful of times before I could actually build something that worked. And all of those failures were not, in fact, failures. They were not wasted time, they weren't even wasted money. Even though I didn't spend that much money on them, they were learning opportunities. They were a chance for me to invest in boosting my own skills. And that brings us on to the third part of Gonzalez comment, which is the fear of wasting money on a bad idea. And that brings us on to myth number three, which is that you need to spend money to start your first business. This is, again, a myth of entrepreneurship and a myth of business that we've been taught. If you watch TV shows like Dragon's Den or Shark Tank or things like that, you will get all these entrepreneurs who are rocking up, asking for investment in their business. And so when someone thinks entrepreneur or someone thinks business, they think, oh, my goodness, I need an investor, I need cash, I need capital in order to start the business. And I think a big reason for this is that when, when most people think of the word business, they actually think of a product business rather than a service business. So if you look on Dragons Den, all of these TV shows where people are coming, coming to entrepreneurs and pitching their idea, it's almost never a service that they're pitching. They're not saying, hey, I've got a web design studio, or I'm a freelance accountant and I do the accounting for small businesses in my local area. That is not sexy, that's really boring. It's not glamorous, it's not going to do well on tv. It's also the sort of business that doesn't need investment. The entrepreneurs that go on these TV shows are the ones who are building some innovative new product. Oh, I built this new massage gun. Oh, I built this new blanket. I've built this new hot sauce. These are product businesses. They are building a physical thing, usually. And yes, those usually do require capital. They usually require investment. And that's why they're on this TV show to try and pitch to investors. But for the most part, business is this absolutely enormous thing. And in my opinion, and in the opinion of a lot of entrepreneurs that I speak to, your first business should not be a product business. Instead, your first business should be a service business. It's when you are selling your time and your skills rather than you are trying to build a product. And there are plenty of service businesses you can start without actually having to spend any money at all. You are simply investing time. And let's do a little thought experiment here. Let's say you are 14 years old and it is the summer holidays. You know, think back to when it was the summer holidays when you were 14 and you were like, man, I've got to find a way to make some money. What might you as a 14 year old think to do to make some money? You probably wouldn't be thinking, damn, I really need some capital to hire some developers to build an app. You probably wouldn't be thinking, damn, I really need some startup money to be able to invent this new product. You'd probably be thinking, hmm, can I go and knock on local houses and offer to mow their lawns? That is a service business. It doesn't cost me as a 14 year old anything to knock on different people's doors and say, hey, I noticed that your grass is a little bit overgrown. Have you got a lawnmower? Yeah. Great, Fantastic. You want to pay me five, ten dollars to mow your lawn for you? They're probably like, yeah, sure, 14 year old, kind of cute, why not? I don't want to mow the law myself. I'm therefore paying for someone else to do it for me. This is a service business. Let's say that 14 year old then gets a little bit older. You know, this is what I did when I was like 16, 17, I started offering private tutoring services to parents in my local area. It did not cost me any money to private tutor someone in their maths or English or science GCSE exams. I just advertised my services on a website called UK Tutors and I got a couple of clients that way. And so again, I wasn't investing any money to start that business. It was a service based business where I was going around people's houses and tutoring the kids in how to pass their GCSE physics exam. That is a service based business. And if I look through this community post, there are so many responses from people saying that the one thing that's stopping them from starting a business is capital. And that would only be true if the first business you want to start requires intensive startup capital. But there are plenty of businesses, as we've just talked about, that you can start that don't require any of that capital. The 14 year old version of you might be mowing lawns. The 17 year old version of you might be doing Private tutoring. The university grad version of you who did a degree in finance might be able to, I don't know, become like a financial controller for small businesses again, offering a service to small businesses. Who will pay you for the service? And all you need is a computer with an Internet connection. You do not need money to start your first business. In fact, I would recommend that for your first couple of businesses, you start businesses that do not require startup capital. Let's talk about myth number four, which comes up a lot in these comments as well, which is the myth that you need to go all in to start your first business. There is A comment from ecath S1 who says, the thing that's stopping me is money. Of course, if I'd secured two years of my expenses, I would start right now. They're saying, matt, the only thing that's stopping me is I just don't have two years worth of living expenses in the bank. If I just had those in the bank, then of course I would start my business. That is also fear. It's fear disguised as a what looks like a practical concern about money. Because broadly, for the most part, for your first business, I wouldn't recommend you quit your job to start your business. I would recommend doing it on the side as a bit of a side hustle. Do it for 20 minutes a day, half an hour a day. Do it in 20, you know, wake up 20 minutes early and work on that business for the first 20 minutes of the day. If you have a corporate job, you're probably not working flat out for all like 8, 9, 10 hours of the day. You could probably take a shorter lunch break if you really wanted to work on that business. You could probably wake up a little bit earlier on a Saturday morning. So you still got all weekend to like hang out with the family. But you could put in two hours in the morning on a Saturday and a Sunday morning when no one else is awake. Because the point of your first business is to learn not to earn. And with that law that like the first three businesses are probably going to fail, you want to get the failures under your belt pretty quickly and you don't need to quit your job and go all in. Working 60 hours a week on your first business in order to rack up the failures and to rack up the skill points that you are gaining through trying out these different businesses. In fact, for many people, doing their businesses in the context of having a day job makes it way easier because now you don't need to make all the money from it straight away. You're not dipping into your savings. You're not like having to worry about not being able to pay the mortgage. But because you haven't got money coming in from this new venture, you're just starting it on the side. You're learning the skills and slowly trying to make money a little bit at a time. I think another big myth that relates to all of this stuff is the myth that your first business needs to give you everything. I think a misconception a lot of people have is that, you know, when I start that business, that's the business that's gonna make me financially free. It's the business that's gonna be fun because I'm gonna be doing something I'm passionate about. It's the business that's gonna feel fulfilling because I'm making a difference in the world. It's a business that's gonna give me time freedom and location freedom. I'll be able to work with people I love wherever I love being able to do whatever I want. There of things, of course, you know, if you have a six or seven figure lifestyle business like I do, you have a lot of those things taken care of. But this business that I've got is not my first business. There's almost no entrepreneur I have ever met who has succeeded with their first business. Usually the first business is something really boring. It's something you're not particularly excited about. It's something that you really, really, really struggle with. But it's something that helps you learn the skills and helps you make a little bit of money. And eventually when you get to the point of like after a couple of businesses, you get to the point where you're able to make money in a way that's de correlated with your time. That tends to be the first major unlock because now you've unlocked freedom from the nine to freedom from the corporate job. And so once you've secured that economic engine, at that point you can start thinking, okay, cool, what business am I really passionate about? What's a business that like, will really make a difference in the world? But if you're trying to have all of these different expectations for your very first business, that's like saying, I don't know. It's like in the dating world, you're like, you know what, I'm not even going to go on a first date unless I can guarantee that that person is going to be the person I marry. They're also going to end up being my business partner. They're also going to end up being My therapist. It's like you've got all of these unrealistic expectations that's stopping you from even going out on that first date. As everyone knows that, like, you know, you meet a bunch of people, you go on a few dates, you see what you like, see what you don't like, you see who you vibe with. Probably the first person you're in a relationship with is not the person you're going to end up marrying on average for most people. In the same way, most people don't end up doing the first business that they start for the rest of their lives. And I think a lot of these people in the comments, people who are afraid to start the first business, are just putting way too much expectation on it. My very first business was doing freelance web design when I was like 13 years old. My next business was trying to build a shitty website that was sort of a pyramid, multi level marketing scheme back when I was like 14, 15 years old. The business after that was this private tutoring stuff where I was making like $100 a week. I tried building a business when I was in school that was helping teenagers learn like spy skills, like lock picking and like martial arts on some online forum. That completely flopped. Then when I got into med school, I built a business that was helping other people get into med school and that worked reasonably well. I tried a bunch of other different business ideas. Some of them were even documented on my YouTube channel. I tried building an app early on back in 2017. Completely flopped. Even within the context of my current business. There are so many things that, that we've tried that haven't really worked. And if me or any of my entrepreneur friends had had that idea at the start that like, man, this first business I start, you know, it's got to work, it's got to have certainty, it's got to give me all the money, the fun, the freedom, the flexibility, the fulfillment. It's got to be meaningful, blah, blah, blah, all of that kind of stuff. We just never would have gotten started at all and we'd still be working in corporate jobs and being really scared that AI is going to be disrupting the whole thing. So really, if there is one message in this video, then that message is if you've been wanting to start a business but you haven't yet, I suspect your bar is too high. You just got to lower the bar, man. You just got to think that your first three businesses are probably going to fail. In the same vein as when I started a YouTube channel, it's helpful to have the rule that my first 50 videos are going to be terrible, but that's okay, because in the process of making those first 50 videos, I will learn the art and the science and the skills of video making so that maybe video number 51 will finally be worth someone's time to watch. In the same vein, it's very useful to have the mental model that my first three businesses are going to fail. And the point of those businesses is to teach me the skills, skills of entrepreneurship, so that when I actually have a good idea, I'm able to actually execute on that idea. Because you can have the best idea in the world right now, but unless you started a business, it's probably not going to work. Various people have the idea for Uber. You know, you probably thought 10, 15, 20 years ago, they're like, man, it's kind of annoying that I have to call up a taxi and, you know, whatever. I wish I could just order a taxi from my phone. That's a pretty good idea. But, like, loads and loads and loads and loads of people had that idea. Ideas are a dime a dozen. The idea is not the thing that stops your business from starting. It's the execution. And the thing that's stopping the execution is the fact that you just haven't done it before. The more you do it, the more you get on that bike and fall off, the more you realize what it feels like to ride a bike, the more you realize what it feels like to start and grow your own business. And eventually you might get to the point 15 years later into that journey where people are then asking you for advice. And you'll see all of these different obstacles that are holding people up. You'll see all these people around you saying, oh, man, I don't have enough money to start. Oh, there's too much competition in the market. Oh, you know, I'm just like, this is like. Like all of these. All of these different excuses, and you'll. You'll recognize where they're coming from because you'll see yourself in those excuses. And you'll be so glad that you took those first steps to start that first business despite not having certainty. This whole thing, this whole game of business is a game of being comfortable with uncertainty and being comfortable with discomfort. We are so addicted to certainty. We're so addicted to, like, making sure that, like, oh, if I'm only going to do that thing, if it's getting me points on my CV further down the line, and we're so addicted to that, that, like, we just don't take the interesting risks and do the interesting things where there's some amount of uncertainty. Going on a date is always a little bit uncertain. Trying a new hobby is always a little bit uncertain. Starting a business is always a little bit uncertain. But if you can get through that uncertainty, if you can be comfortable with it, if you can surf the wave of the uncertainty, that is where the learning is happening. And that's where you build up the skills that no one else is building up because they're too afraid of taking that first step. And just as a reminder, you've got the totally free Adobe Express template that you you can download that gives you all of the prompts that I would recommend when it comes to thinking about your first couple of business ideas. If you've gotten value from this video, then you might actually check out this video over here, which is my honest advice to someone who wants financial freedom. And that is a conversation I had with a friend of mine that sort of touches on some of the themes, but you might find that interesting. And there's a bunch of different, like book and podcast recommendations in that video as well. So thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time.","80-60324: There are various myths that people believe about starting a business

The video debunks common myths about starting a business, emphasizing that failure is a natural part of the entrepreneurial journey. Ali, the speaker, shares his experience of building multiple businesses while addressing fears like needing a ""perfect"" idea, wasting time/money, requiring capital, quitting jobs, and expecting immediate success. He advocates starting with low-risk service-based businesses, using iterative learning, and leveraging free tools like Adobe Express’s business planning template. Key takeaways include prioritizing action over perfection, reframing failure as skill-building, and lowering unrealistic expectations for early ventures.

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:00] There are various myths that people believe about starting a business**  
Ali introduces the video by referencing a poll where viewers cited fears like lacking good ideas and wasting resources. He shares his entrepreneurial background (building businesses while in med school and later full-time) and frames the video as a guide to debunking myths, stressing that failures are inevitable and valuable learning steps.

**[01:00-03:03] Myth number one: You need a good idea to start a business**  
Ali argues that *any* idea suffices for a first business, as early ventures are likely to fail but teach critical skills. He compares entrepreneurship to learning to ride a bike—failure is part of the process. Citing James Altucher, he advises generating 50+ low-quality ideas to overcome perfectionism, stressing that execution matters more than the idea itself.  

**[03:03-04:57] This video includes a free business planning template designed by Adobe Express**  
Ali showcases a free Adobe Express template he co-created, guiding viewers through brainstorming. It includes prompts for identifying target customers, problem statements, and validation strategies (e.g., finding 10 potential customers). He references frameworks from books like *Million Dollar Weekend* and *Feel-Good Productivity*, emphasizing rapid testing (e.g., charging $1 for a prototype) to validate demand.  

**[04:57-07:18] You can use Adobe Express to brainstorm business ideas for free**  
Ali demonstrates the template with examples: freelance video editing for YouTubers, dog walking, and Airbnb management. He highlights Adobe Express’s customization tools, like brand kits and AI-generated images, to make brainstorming visual and actionable. The template encourages starting with “who” (target customers) rather than “what” (product) to ensure market alignment.  

**[07:18-10:08] Myth number one is that time spent on a business that fails is time wasted**  
Ali reframes failure as skill-building, comparing it to falling while learning to bike. He acknowledges financial security concerns but argues most people overestimate their need for certainty. Early businesses are “investments” in entrepreneurial skills, not wastes of time. He shares his own six failed ventures before achieving success, stressing that resilience and adaptability are earned through trial and error.  

**[10:08-10:39] Myth that time spent on a business that fails is time wasted**  
(This chapter appears redundant but likely reinforces Myth 2: Failure teaches resilience, and avoiding risk stifles growth. Ali ties this to societal conditioning favoring stability over experimentation, urging viewers to embrace uncertainty as a path to financial independence in an AI-disrupted economy.)  

**[10:39-13:57] Myth number three: You need to spend money to start your first business**  
Ali challenges the notion that capital is essential, advocating for service-based businesses (e.g., tutoring, lawn mowing) requiring minimal investment. He critiques TV shows like *Shark Tank* for glamorizing product-based startups, which often need funding, and urges viewers to start with time-for-money services. Examples include his teenage tutoring gig and freelance web design.  

**[13:57-15:31] Myth number four is that you need to quit your job to start your business**  
Ali advises against quitting stable jobs initially, recommending side hustles (e.g., 20 minutes/day) to test ideas risk-free. He critiques the “all-in” mindset, noting that early businesses should prioritize learning, not income. By framing entrepreneurship as a skill acquired incrementally, he reduces pressure to achieve immediate financial freedom.  

**[15:31-20:52] Myth that your first business needs to give you everything is unrealistic**  
Ali compares first businesses to first dates—unlikely to fulfill all expectations (passion, freedom, income). Most entrepreneurs start with “boring” ventures (e.g., his tutoring business) to build foundational skills. He urges viewers to iterate: early businesses unlock time freedom, enabling later passion-driven projects. Overloading a first venture with unrealistic goals paralyzes action.  

Key Points:  
- Early businesses often fail but teach critical entrepreneurial skills.  
- Service-based ventures (e.g., freelancing) require minimal capital and lower risk.  
- Execution > ideas: Rapid validation (e.g., charging $1 early) trumps perfectionism.  
- Side hustles allow testing without quitting jobs or financial instability.  
- Lower expectations for first businesses—focus on learning, not ideal outcomes.

Insight/Outlook: Embracing early failures as skill-building opportunities can demystify entrepreneurship, enabling gradual, sustainable success in an evolving economy."
audio_7.mp3,"All right, so if you clicked on this video, then you're probably very understandably interested in making more money. Now, I have made dozens of videos all about starting your own business as one path towards making a lot of money. But the reality is that entrepreneurship isn't right for most people and actually only about 7% of the population are going to be entrepreneurs. The vast majority of people, maybe including you, are employees working in regular jobs. So if you're in that 93%, how do you actually make more money? How do you work towards financial security without quitting your job and just starting a business? Now this is a question that doesn't get nearly enough attention. We are constantly bombarded with messages about side hustles and passive income and entrepreneurship. But what if you actually like your job and what if you want to advance in your career rather than just throw it away and leave it behind? Now, as someone who left a traditional career in medicine to make these silly videos on the Internet, I am obviously nowhere near an expert on the topic. And so for this video I wanted to have a conversation with Jenny Wood. Now, Jenny is a former Google executive and Harvard Business School researcher who founded the own youn Career Program which is Google's largest career development program. She's helped thousands of people transform their careers and earn way more money through her talks and through her wonderful book Wild Courage, which you should definitely read if you to make more money in your job. Most people think that to make more money you have to go start your own business. That that's what gives you financial freedom. Well, you can find financial freedom right within your own company. Get promoted, you keep getting raises that interest compounds. You could be making seven figures right within your own company. Quick caveat here. Now Jenny worked at Google in the US where it's not uncommon to have a seven figure million dollar plus salary. If you're not in tech or finance or another high paying field, please don't fixate on the specific number. The point is that there is a lot within your control that can help you earn significantly more r regardless of your industry. And so in this video we are going to dive into nine practical strategies that Jenny shared with me during our conversation. And if you apply any of these strategies, you are going to have a way better time at work and be way more likely to get a raise and thus make more money and thus be on your path towards financial freedom. I'm also going to be adding in my own hot takes on the advice that Jenny shares because I'm an entrepreneur with a team of like 20 people. And so I'm actually on the other side of these conversations. I'm the guy having the conversation with my team members who want more money. And the tips we're going to talk about in this video are things that I completely agree with, because if my own team members did these things, they'd be way more likely to get raises and promotions. Start with strategy number one, which is to become your boss's favorite employee. Now, this one is going to make some people uncomfortable because it can sound a lot like sucking up. But here is Jenny's take on exactly why you should become your boss's favorite employee. You should try to become your boss's favorite employee because your boss can determine the future of your success, your career, and your financial freedom. Now, obviously, this makes perfect sense if you think about it. Your boss is most likely the one who approves your raises or recommends you for promotions or assigns you to interesting and valuable projects. But what's interesting is that the relationship with your boss doesn't affect just your career. It actually affects your entire wellbeing. How our boss feels about us has a tremendous impact on our happiness, our productivity, our livelihood, our engagement, our motivation. I would almost argue that it's a more important relationship than your partner or your spouse. Wait, what? The relationship with your boss is more important than the relationship with your spouse? How does that work with your partner or your spouse? You know that there's that fundamental level of trust there, like it's baseline. You can count on it. If you have a little argument, you know, at 2pm, you can resolve it by 8pm but when you're unsure about how your manager feels about you, that is almost more damaging. When your boss doesn't like you, it feels frustrating and stressful and you feel anxious and sometimes sleep deprived. You start thinking that you're not going to be able to grow or get promoted or get a raise. For me personally, I had situations back when I had a real job working medicine, where when I'd be working with a manager or a boss or a senior doctor who I knew didn't like me. Oh man. That would make going to work such a stressful experience. When we're stressed about how our boss feels about us, all we can think about is that thing that you're not good at. And that negativity has such a dramatically negative impact on your health, on your psychology, on your emotions, on your mental well being, on your physical well being. Okay, so these are all the reasons why having a poor relationship with your boss is pretty terrible. For you. And if you've been in that position, you probably know how it feels. But let's now talk about the flip side. Why is it important to aim towards becoming your boss's favorite employee? When your boss values you and likes you, you feel like you're walking on air. You feel like your career is on a rocket ship. You feel like you're probably going to land that next promotion, you're probably going to get that raise. And not just that, because those are aspirational goals, but you feel happy in your day to day. You feel more confident when you write an email to your peers, to a client, to a partner, to a stakeholder. And that feeling of confidence fuels more overall growth. All right, so hopefully that convinced you that step one towards making more money as an employee within the context of your job is to get your manager or your boss to really, really, really like and value you. Now how do you do that? Well, that's what the rest of this video is going to be about. And so we now have point number two, which is actually prepare for your one on ones. So if you're watching this and you have a job, you probably have a manager and you probably have some form of regular one on one conversations with your manager. The question is how much time do you spend preparing for those conversations? And here I'm going to share some examples that Jenny shared with me. So this is what people do? Yeah, absolutely nothing. It's just like an empty Google Doc with like nothing written in it. This is what the majority of people do to prepare for their one on ones. The next level up from that is something like this. I have some ideas for hiking backpack sales. We're testing new marketing. I'd love to do a career check in soon. You know, it's better than nothing, but it's still pretty crap. But what Jenny recommends instead, as a professional career coach and someone who helps people get promotions and raises and someone who actually gives people promotions and raises. When she was working at Google and has done the research on this, this is how she recommends preparing for your one on ones of four categories for your one on one document or three plus one, let's call it business operations people. And then every four to six weeks add career and put bullets in there with numbers and links every single week and so on screen. This is an example that Jenny shared with me of what you could be writing in terms of preparation for your one on ones. There is a link to the Google Doc version of this down in the video description if you want to check it out directly. But if you're serious about this making more money in your career stuff, I would recommend pausing the video, having a look at this document and comparing it with the amount of preparation you currently do or don't do for your own one on ones. This is the best use of your time because it's not just what you do that matters for your career, it's what your manager thinks you do. This is worth repeating. It's not just what you do that matters for your career, it is what your manager thinks you do. And that brings us on to point number three, which is the shameless Monday morning email. This is something that she talks about in the book as well. You can find way more details about this and all of the other strategies in the book if you want to read it. The biggest career fallacy you will hear is keep your head down, do good work. Your work will speak for itself. Spoiler alert. No it won't. Visibility matters. Now, a lot of people, especially people junior in their careers, will think, oh, this is unfair. Like my boss, my manager should. It's their job to recognize my work and to reward me for it. But it's just really not how it works. Your manager isn't a mind reader. If they've got seven direct reports, they've got seven times as many things on their plate as you have on your plate. And so it's not a case of your manager is malicious or like toxic or whatever. I mean, they might be, but like that's, that's a side point. And there's details in the book if you want to, if you want to have that issue. It's usually not that they don't care about you, they want to care about you. They want you to do a good job, they want to be a good manager. It's just that they have too much stuff on their plate. And so you being more proactive about showing what you are working on is super, super helpful. And one very easy way to do this is sending an email to your boss or your manager every Monday morning. It's basically a manifesto of what you did the last week and what you're going to do this week. Things you accomplished last week that you're proud of, things you're going to work on to move the business forward next week. But I call it a minifesto because it should Only take you 15 minutes to write and it's going to feel scary and hard to do the first time, but you will get into such a rhythm that it becomes totally normal. And if you're spending more than 15 minutes on this. You are spending too long on it. And again, very kindly, Jenny has provided us an example. So this is an example of what your Monday email could look like. Here is a quick update on my work from last week and what's on my radar for this week. Last week highlights 1 and 2. This week's priorities 1 and 2. Excited to chat more about this in our 1 to 1. You can send this as an email, you can send it as a Slack DM, you can send it as a WhatsApp message. And if you are a manager who happens to be watching this video, imagine how great you would feel if your own direct reports were to send you an email like this every Monday morning, completely unprompted. That just gave you a bit more visibility about what the hell they are actually doing. That would be so cool, right? And yet like so few people do stuff like this. This is such an easy thing to do. It just takes 15 minutes to do and it gives your boss or your manager way more visibility over exactly what you're doing. All right, so normally at this point I would tell you about the video sponsor and this video sponsor happens to be me because I would like to sponsor this video with my own product. It's called VoicePal. It is the ghostwriter in your pocket. VoicePal is an app available for iOS and Android. My team and I have been building it over the last 12 months and I've been using it for the last 12 months for any kind of writing that I need to do. So if you have to do any kind of writing for your work or for your creative stuff or whatever. The thing is, instead of sitting at a computer and staring at a blank screen trying to type stuff out, you might find that like me, you're much better at spe speaking your thoughts out loud. So in VoicePal, you basically just go on a walk, you hit record, you speak whatever you want to speak, the app will ask you sensible follow up questions based on what you've said and you can export it to your computer or wherever else you'd like to do your editing every single week. By using VoicePal A, I generate more ideas, I'm able to expand on those ideas, and I save way more time and have way more fun walking around speaking out my content that I need to write for various things rather than sitting hunched on the computer typing and getting writer's block. So if you need to do any kind of writing for your professional life or your creator life, or your entrepreneurial life or Anything like that, then I would love it. If you can check out VoicePal, there is a link down below. So thank you, VoicePal, for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. All right, let's move on to tip number four, which is you versus I. I call this woo with you. When you're communicating with your boss, try to start as many sentences as possible, verbally or written, with the word you rather than the word I. Now, this is a hack that you can apply to the way you communicate verbally and in a written fashion in any kind of professional context, maybe even in any kind of personal context. And here is an example that illustrates it. She was doing a talk for some company and she wrote the first variation of this email. Hi, Adam, I loved the gift box you sent. I enjoyed doing the keynote because I'm passionate about helping people thrive. I love helping people achieve their goals. So thank you for inviting me, Jenny. So there's way more instances of the word I than the word you in that particular email. So as Jenny talks about in her book, she rewrote this email to focus on you rather than focus on I. And this is the rewriting of that email. Hi, Adam, thank you for the gift box you sent. Your team was such a great group and you made it seamless to partner. Appreciate you creating an opportunity to contribute to your team's goals. I can't wait to do it again, Jenny. And this is a very simple example of how shifting the focus from I and moving more towards you is actually a really powerful communication technique that you can use in almost any context. Most people anchor on what's in it for them. Let's say you're in a job interview. I want to grow in this way. I want to learn this thing. I want to build my network. But that's wrong. That is thinking that is going to hold you back. Because when you're getting interviewed for a job or you're trying to prove to your boss that you're ready for promotion, they want to know how you can move the business. What metrics can you move? Can you increase customer satisfaction? Can you increase revenue? Can you make the operations faster? Can you make systems more productive? They're the one paying you, right? The growth and the development and the skills they'll follow. Of course you'll learn and grow and do cool things and double your network, but focus on what's in it for the company. This is a quick tip for job interviews as well. I've hired lots of people over the years. I have seen thousands of resumes at this point. I've done dozens of interviews, and there are some people that are really good at job interviews. And most people just really suck at doing job interviews because they haven't been taught this kind of stuff. But one very easy thing to do is to recognize that the person interviewing you, they don't actually care about you. They care about themselves. They care about what value you can add to their company. If I'm hiring you and I ask you in a job interview, why do you want this job? You probably shouldn't say something like, I want this job because it'll really help me learn. And I love the idea of working with your team and I've seen some of your videos over the last few years and I would love to learn how to do the social media stuff because I want a career in, like, the creator economy. This is sort of stuff people say in job interviews, but it's not really what I want to hear. It's like, yeah, great, I know that you want to learn stuff, but I'm going to be the one paying your salary. If you wanted to learn all this stuff, you should be paying me, But I'm the one paying you if you. If you're going to get this job. So, like, what's in it for me? And so an alternative way to answer the question of, like, why do you want this job? Might be to say something like, I really want this job because I think I can add a lot of value to you and your business. I've got skills in X, Y and Z which I know can help your mission of helping people build a life they love, or, like, growing your personal brand or like, helping you sell more books or helping you sell more courses. All of this stuff that I can do will help increase your revenue and your profit, which means you'll be able to invest more resources in, like, furthering the mission. And on the side, I'm hoping to learn stuff as well. It's like you're leading with the value to the person you're communicating with. You're leading with you and you're like bringing in the. And I want to learn stuff on the side. Whereas people often, like, flip this around or they just don't think about the you thing at all. And it's totally understandable. Like a question like, why do you want this job? The honest answer to the question is, well, because I think it'd be cool and it makes money and it will help me learn stuff. But that is not the right thing to say at an interview. Because the employer doesn't care about you at that point. They care about themselves. They care about the value you can provide them because they're the one who are fundamentally paying you. Oh, and by the way, if you are interested, we've actually got an internal document that we have as a list of powerful questions that we encourage team members to ask to me and to Angus, who's the general manager of the business, and team members to ask to their own managers. This document with all the questions is freely available on my website. There is a link down below if you want to check it out. All right, let's move on to tip number five, which is to tame the octopus. And really the key skill that we want to learn here is communicating with conviction. Communicating with conviction is one of the most critical skills that anybody can learn, no matter where the they are in their career, no matter what level they are at any organization. So this tool is called Tame the Octopus and it's about how to have more succinct communication so that you can be more compelling and more influential and speak with more authority in a team meeting, in a one on one with your boss. It's basically how to stop rambling. Now here is an example of a little role play that Jenny and I did as an example of how to tame the octopus. Jenny, what are the challenges that your team are facing this quarter? Oh, well, gosh, there are so many challenges where a brand new team. So we've got all sorts of goals that we have to figure out. We've got lots of priorities and we have to figure out like what's the important stuff and what's the unimportant stuff. Which reminds me that all the tools that we're working on are kind of like all over the place. We've got some stuff in a spreadsheet, we've got some third party tools, we've got stuff going on with the API, which also makes me think about the fact that there's a lot to keep track of with our global organizations. We've got teams in Europe, teams in America, teams in Asia, and with all the people sitting across the globe, we really need to be aligned and it's hard to figure out the alignment and. But think about how that sounds to your boss. Go on. That sounds terrible. It sounds terrible, right? You asked me what are your biggest challenges and I gave you a big bowl of word salad that is not going to get your boss to fall in love with you. All right, so that was a bad example of what this looks like. Let's now look at what happens when Jenny tames the octopus and gives a better response. So, Jenny, what are the challenges that your team is facing this quarter? Good question. Let me think about that for just a sec. The biggest challenges my team is facing are number one, priorities, number two, tools, and number three, global alignment priorities. Because we're a brand new team and we have to figure out the important versus the unimportant tools, because we're doing some things in house, some things with a third party, and we want to be more buttoned up across all of our tooling strategy. And number three, global alignment, because we sit across Americas, Asia and Europe, we need to work more in concert together, not in opposition with each other. So the three biggest challenges my team is facing right now are priorities, tools, and global alignment. That's much nicer. How much easier was that to follow? I'm like, oh, okay, I get it right. Exactly. And so what did I do there? I paused. I took a moment to write down maybe five or six or seven things that I could say. I circled three that felt the most relevant. And then when I started talking, I led with just those words. Just the word priorities, just the word tools, and just the phrase global alignment. Then I gave a little bit of information on each one, and finally I buttoned it all up, repeating those same three key things. People feel nervous, feel insecure about pausing, as if they'll sound stupid to their boss or to their teammates, or they'll sound unprepared. But it actually has the opposite effect. You sound more prepared and more poised and smarter and more buttoned up. And it's the kind of thing you can do right there in your team meeting before you even come off of mute common sense, but rarely common practice. There is another key tip to taming the octopus, which is something that I absolutely love. I love it when my team do this. It annoys me when they don't do this, which is basically give three options with a point of view. I call this give three options. Have a pov. Let's say you work at an ice cream manufacturer and you have to decide should your strategy this next year be vanilla ice cream, strawberry ice cream, or chocolate ice ice cream. No matter where you are in your career, you will always impress your boss if you go to them and say, well, these are our three options. Strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate. And I recommend that we double down on strawberry. Here's the data behind it. Here's what's trending in the market, and I recommend it for XYZ reasons. Now this seems like common sense, but it's really not common practice. And I asked Jenny, why don't people do this more often? People don't practice communicating this way. People think that maybe it looks like they're trying too hard. Like, oh, what? I'm going to write down my answers before I. Before I start talking? Heck, yeah. You're gonna write down your answers before you start talking. All right, let's move on to point number six now, which is the grab first slide template. Now, if you're an employee in any kind of business, chances are you're gonna have to create some sort of slide deck from time to time. And here are Jenny's thoughts on how to improve your first slide so that you can be way more likely to become your boss's favorite employee and make more money and all of that fun stuff. What's common is that everybody spends hours putting together their 40 slide deck, perfecting the data, making sure the font size and the design all looks great. But what's counterintuitive is how critical that first slide is. You want that first slide to grab their attention so they know exactly what you're asking for. So again, thank you, Jenny, for providing this example. This is an example of a pretty bad slide. It's too much data. There's unclear purpose. There's no clear request behind why we're being presented with all this information. Again, you want to recognize the executive or the boss or the manager or the person you're presenting to. Chances are they are way busier than you are because they probably have more stuff and more responsibilities on their plate with higher stakes than you probably do. And so the grab method that Jenny talks about is about how to make your first slide grab someone's attention by giving them the key information they need up front. So this is an example of what a normal person who hasn't been trained in this stuff might have as their crappy first slide. And side by side, we'll show you an example of what the grab slide looks like with the information filled in. And if you are an executive or a manager attending a presentation, it's just so much nicer to get all the information you need upfront and to know what the point of the presentation is rather than to have that thing happening 27 minutes into the half an hour presentation. All right, next we move on to point number seven, which is to become an energizer. And you know what? There is no asset that's more in demand at any organization than being a net positive energy contributor. Now, I Want you to imagine a manager who has like six one on one meetings in a day, back to back on their calendar. That's what most managers calendars look like. Maybe that's what your calendar looks like if you're a manager. Now, there are some people on that list that they will look forward to the meeting and there are some people on that list that they're going to dread the meeting. Now the question for you is, are you one of those people where your manager looks forward to meeting with you, or are you one of those people, if you're being honest with yourself, are you one of those people that your manager dreads meeting? Generally what separates these two groups is are you a net positive energy contributor? Are you an energizer? Do you give the other person energy? Do you create energy for the people around you or are you a bit negative? Are you a bit down? Are you a bit complaining, a bit criticizey? Do you drain energy from the context that you're in? This is not to say that if you're having issues at work, you shouldn't bring them up obviously, but just sort of day to day. Do you think you add more energy to the people around you or do you think you take energy away from the people around you? You probably know people, right? That you hang out with them, you're in a meeting with them and you feel good about it afterwards. You also probably know people, some people in your team, maybe some people in your personal life, you hang out with them and you sort of feel drained afterwards. Like which of those people are you? You are way more likely to become your boss's favorite employee or to be your boss's favorite employee and therefore get all the promotions and raises and stuff if you are a net energy contributor. There's actually research that I cited in my own book, Feel Good Productivity that has been done in organizations where they create this sort of energy map and they ask all of the people in the organization who's like an energizer and who's a drainer, and then they map it all on like a piece of paper or a graph, whatever, and they find that the people who are energizers, they make more money, they get more promotions, they get better evaluations from their peers, they get better evaluations from their managers, they're better on objective tests of job performance as well. There's just so much value to being able positive contributor to the environment that you are in. You want to be one of the energizers, you want to be a radiator you want to be one of the people that your boss looks forward to meeting with each day. When someone is a net positive energy contributor, that relationship that they build with their boss as a result of that ends up helping them stay around longer. Get promoted, get a raise. Because people like to do work with people that they like. And there is a bunch more advice in this book about exactly how to become an energizer in if you currently think you are not one of those people. All right, now we move on to tip number eight, which is to schedule a career development conversation. It can be really hard to ask to ask for what you want or just even to ask for help in general. But asking for help in your career is one of the ways that you can be most successful. Get a promotion, get a raise, have a dedicated 30 to 45 minute meeting. Title of the meeting. And this is critical, nobody thinks about this. The title should be career development conversation, not your regular one on one title that sends the signal that this is all about your career, your growth, your desire to get a raise, your desire to get a promotion. Now this is something that you can do with your own manager. It's also something you can do with your manager's manager. Yes, that's right. You could actually get to know your boss's boss. This is something Jenny talks about in the book as well. Honestly, this is something I wish my team probably did more of. Like I'm not the direct manager for anyone in my team except my general manager, Angus. And almost no one in my team messages me to say, hey Ali, I would love to chat to you 15 minute, 30 minute phone call to, you know, talk about my career, career development or anything like that. If they did, I would say, yeah, sure, of course, of course, that makes perfect sense. But they're probably worried about messaging me because I'm not technically their manager and they don't want to waste my time and stuff. But like, feels weird to admit this, but they are probably holding themselves back by not proactively communicating with me directly and thinking that my time is too valuable for them. Yeah, it might take me a while to respond to the message. It might have to be at a weird time because I'm in a weird time zone and stuff. But like someone having a career development conversation with me directly, even beyond their manager, is going to be a very, very, very helpful thing for their career. In fact, this is something I talked to Jenny about in the podcast and this is what she said about her own experience. For the first 10 years I was at Google. I held back, I was insecure. I was rife with imposter syndrome. I was terrified to set up a one on one with my boss's boss. And it was so limiting in my career and it cut off so many opportunities that I would have had otherwise. When you build a relationship not just with your own manager, but with your manager's and maybe the other people at that level of the leadership team or whatever size organization you're in, you're way more likely to get raises and promotions. Because usually in most organizations, raises and promotions are not a one person decision. There's usually a group of people that are making those decisions. And so if you have positive relationships not just with your manager, but also with their peers or also your manager's manager and maybe some of their peers, you're way more likely to get these promotions and get these raises. And yeah, you can maybe argue that, oh, this is workplace politics, I shouldn't have to do that. Yeah, I agree, you shouldn't have to do that. But again, a point that comes up in Jenny's book quite a lot is that a business is simply a social group that needs customers. A business is simply a social group that needs customers. And I think this is really true. Like I kind of laughed out loud when, when she first told me this idea, but that's basically what it is. Like I have a team of about 20 people and it's basically a social group that happens to need customers. Right, because we got to pay the bills. And so the stuff that works in a friendship group, being an energizer, being a positive influence in the group, being someone that people look forward to hanging out with, that stuff goes a long way towards getting ahead. And then finally, tip number nine is to work together with your manager on getting you a raise. You always want to lead with what and how questions when you're asking for a promotion. What might it look like to partner on a promotion? How can we work together to achieve a raise in six months? Never. Yes or no questions. Can I get a raise? No. Can my raise be $20,000? No. You want to give them the opportunity to weigh in so that they can buy it. And you do that by asking open ended questions and making them part of the team that's going to get you promoted. We are not going to go into in depth advice in this video about specifically how to get a raise. She talks about it a lot in the book, which you can check out and I'll put some links to more of Jenny's resources down in the video Description so this video was a little bit of a departure from tradition and the usual content we have about how to become financially free by starting your own business. But if you're at this point in the video, I hope you got some value from it. And I would love to know in the comments what is one actionable point that you are going to take forward from this video? Because otherwise the video just ends up being another one of those things that you watch and rarely take action on. I'm not throwing shade on you. I do the same as well. I watch all these YouTube videos. I very rarely take action on them, but I but some videos where the YouTuber prompts me to take action, I'll be like, oh yeah, I actually do want to take action on this, so I'm going to do something about it. Anyway, I'd love to hear in the comments what you thought of this video and what action you're going to take as a result. And if you do have a normal job and you're interested in molding your career in a way that helps you build a career that you love, check out this video over here. This is a book club episode that I did with Professor Grace Lorden of the London School of Economics, which is less about how to specifically get a raise, but more about how to mold your career in a way that actually feels more meaningful and fulfilling for you. So you can check that out right over there. Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video. Bye.","80-127440: Only about 7% of the population are going to be entrepreneurs

**Chapter Summaries:**  

**[00:00-02:07] Only about 7% of the population are going to be entrepreneurs**  
Ali introduces the video by acknowledging that entrepreneurship isn’t feasible for most people and shifts focus to career advancement within traditional jobs. He introduces Jenny Wood, a Google career expert, to share strategies for financial growth through promotions and raises. The chapter sets the premise: employees can achieve financial freedom by mastering workplace dynamics rather than starting a business.  

**[02:07-04:46] How our boss feels about us has a tremendous impact on our happiness**  
Jenny argues that a manager’s perception significantly affects an employee’s well-being, productivity, and career trajectory. A poor relationship causes stress and stagnation, while a positive one boosts confidence and growth. Ali shares personal anecdotes about stressful manager interactions, reinforcing the idea that manager rapport is critical—even likening it in importance to spousal relationships.  

**[04:46-06:15] How much time do you spend preparing for your manager one-on-one conversations**  
Jenny critiques the lack of preparation most employees invest in one-on-one meetings. She shares a structured template (linked in the description) to organize discussions into categories like business operations, people, and career goals. The key takeaway: visibility of your work to your manager is as crucial as the work itself.  

**[06:15-08:26] The shameless Monday morning email gives your boss visibility over your work**  
Jenny advocates for a weekly “minifesto” email to managers, summarizing past achievements and upcoming priorities in 15 minutes. This proactive communication ensures visibility, counters the myth that “work speaks for itself,” and aligns with managers’ busy schedules. An example email template highlights brevity and clarity.  

**[08:26-09:24] VoicePal is an app available for iOS and Android. It is the ghostwriter in your pocket**  
Ali promotes his app, VoicePal, which helps users brainstorm and draft content via voice recordings. He explains its utility for overcoming writer’s block and streamlining professional writing tasks.  

**[09:24-13:07] Tip number four is you versus I when communicating with your boss**  
Jenny emphasizes framing communication around the manager’s needs (using “you”) rather than the employee’s (“I”). Examples contrast self-centered vs. value-driven language, particularly in job interviews. Ali adds that employers prioritize how candidates can solve their problems, not the candidate’s personal growth.  

**[13:07-14:35] Communicating with conviction is one of the most critical skills that anybody can learn**  
Jenny introduces “Tame the Octopus”—a method to structure communication succinctly. She role-plays a rambling response vs. a polished one, stressing the importance of pausing, prioritizing three key points, and repeating them for clarity. This approach projects confidence and professionalism.  

**[14:35-16:20] The biggest challenges my team is facing right now are priorities, tools, and global alignment**  
Expanding on “Tame the Octopus,” Jenny advises presenting three options with a recommendation (e.g., “We should prioritize strawberry ice cream because...”). This strategy demonstrates initiative and critical thinking, impressing managers by simplifying decision-making.  

**[16:20-18:31] You want your first slide to grab someone's attention during a presentation**  
Jenny’s “grab first slide” method prioritizes clarity in presentations. A strong opening slide should state the purpose, key data, and request upfront, respecting executives’ time. Examples contrast cluttered slides with concise, action-oriented ones.  

**[18:31-20:45] Being a net positive energy contributor is incredibly valuable at any organization**  
Ali and Jenny discuss the importance of radiating positivity (“energizers”) vs. draining negativity (“drainers”). Research shows energizers receive better evaluations and promotions. Tips include fostering optimism and making meetings enjoyable for managers.  

**[20:45-23:30] Tip number eight is to schedule a career development conversation**  
Jenny urges employees to proactively schedule career-focused meetings with their manager (or their manager’s manager). These discussions should be explicitly titled “career development” to signal intent. Building relationships beyond direct managers increases promotion opportunities.  

**[23:30-25:09] Tip number nine is to work together with your manager on getting you a raise**  
When seeking raises, Jenny advises collaborative phrasing (e.g., “How can we achieve this?”) over yes/no questions. Involving managers in the process increases buy-in. Ali adds that promotions often involve group decisions, reinforcing the need for broad relationship-building.  

---

**Key Points:**  
- Strong manager relationships directly impact career success, happiness, and raises.  
- Proactive communication (e.g., weekly emails, structured one-on-ones) ensures visibility.  
- Framing conversations around the manager’s needs (“you”) builds rapport and value.  
- Being a “net positive energy contributor” increases likability and promotion likelihood.  
- Career advancement requires explicit, collaborative goal-setting with leadership.  

**Tags:** career development, communication skills, workplace strategies, promotions, employee engagement  

**Insight/Outlook:**  
Mastering workplace dynamics—through intentional communication, visibility, and positivity—can accelerate career growth as effectively as entrepreneurial ventures, offering a viable path to financial freedom within traditional employment."
audio_8.mp3,"If you struggle with procrastination, if you struggle to do hard things, if you struggle with discipline sometimes, then hopefully this video is for you. Because in this world of self help, personal development, there's one thing that very few people are talking about and that is the overwhelming impact of negative emotions that prevent us from doing things and actually getting started with stuff. So it's not that you're lazy or unmotivated or undisciplined. It's that there is a sinister emotion holding you back. And that emotion is fear. And so in this video, we're going to talk through six micro experiments that you can try that will hopefully help reduce the impact of fear and that'll hopefully help you stop procrastinating and finally get started with whatever you've been putting off. If you're new here. Hello, my name is Ali. I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur and author. And since 2017 I've been making videos on this channel about the books, strategies and tools that can help us live more intentionally, be more productive and generally build a life that we love. I also spent absolutely ages researching and writing my book Feel Good Productivity, which is now a New York Times bestseller. And this really dives deep into how we can get stuff done without burning out or without sacrificing the things that really matter. It's available in all formats, Paperback, Kindle, Audible, and has been translated into 35 languages with thousands of five star reviews. So if that sounds interesting, there's a link down below. Now this video is going to be a little bit different from normal because going to be combining some of my own thoughts with some animated sections from the audiobook of Feel Good Productivity. And to start, I want to share my own experience of putting off something that was really important to me and what I eventually realized was stopping me from actually getting started. It took me seven years to launch my business. I'd wanted to start a YouTube channel since 2010. But whenever I thought about shooting that first video, I'd experience some force preventing me from taking the plunge. I thought I was putting it off because of my perfectionism. I didn't want to produce videos that totally sucked. But looking back, I now realize I was wrong. Something else was holding me back. Fear. The fear of failure, the fear of judgment, the fear of not being good enough. In the end, I didn't create a video until 2017. I thought I was just being lazy or not committed enough and that fueled my self doubt and negative self talk. But once I started to understand the role that fear was playing, in my life, I was able to identify it as the primary obstacle still standing between me and my ambitions. Knowledge is power. Getting to know our fears is the first step towards overcoming them. Now, in the process of writing this book, I did a ton of research into the science of procrastination. Just really trying to understand why we don't take action on the things that we say we want to do. And honestly, one of the biggest realizations that isn't talked about enough is that procrastination isn't just about motivation or discipline. It's often about fear and anxiety. And the reason for this is something called the amygdala hijack. So basically our brains threat detection system, the amygdala, it kicks into overdrive whenever we perceive something as scary or uncertain, even if there's no real danger. So instead of lions and tigers and bears, which are a genuine threat, it starts seeing things like posting on LinkedIn or starting my YouTube channel, or like quitting my job to like follow my passion. It starts to see these as a genuine threat to our safety. And so to keep us safe, it nudges us towards the easiest, safest option, which is often to do absolutely nothing. But the good news is once we understand this, we can work with it. And so let's get into the six experiments that you can try to beat procrastination and hopefully finally take action on whatever it is that you've been putting off. Experiment number one. All right, so there is a fun study that illustrates this which I write about in the book. Basically there was a group of researchers at UCLA and they got a bunch of people who were afraid of spiders to get close to a Chilean rose haired tarantula. Now some of these people were told to distract themselves, some of them were told to reframe the fear or something else. But one group was asked to just name their fear out loud. Like say out loud something like, I feel anxious that the spider is going to jump on me or whatever the thing is. And the results of this basically showed that the group that labeled their fear felt less afraid and were more likely to actually approach the spider. Just putting their emotions into words helped them process their fear rather than being controlled by it. Now in the field of psychology, this is called affective labeling and it applies to procrastination as well. We very rarely say something like I am afraid of failure or I'm afraid of what people think of me. Instead we say things like, oh, I'm too busy right now or I don't have the right idea or I don't have the time right now. But it's really when we acknowledge the real fear that's holding us back from doing the thing, that's when it can lose its grip on us. So this is experiment number one, the emotion label. And let's segue briefly into the audiobook to explain this. It's the act of putting your feelings into words which forces you to identify and get to know the sensations you're experiencing. It works in two ways. First, it increases our self awareness. By naming and acknowledging our fears, we cultivate a deeper self awareness that helps us better understand our emotional patterns. Second, it reduces our rumination. Cyclical thoughts about our fears can make us even more convinced the fear is justified. When we label our emotions, we become better able to process and release them and so escape the cyclical thoughts that make us put things off. The trouble is, labeling our emotions isn't always straightforward. We're very good at rationalizing reasonable reasons for not doing things. I'm not putting off starting my business because I'm scared of something. I just haven't found the right idea yet. So how can we get into the habit of naming, obviously, and so learning to process them. One method involves asking yourself a few questions. When you're procrastinating, say to yourself, what am I afraid of? Our core vulnerabilities and insecurities are often at the heart of procrastination. Next, take it a step further and ask yourself, where does this fear come from? Is it a me reason or a them reason? Me reasons are fears associated with your perception of your ability. For example, being scared that you're not good enough or not well prepared enough to start them. Reasons are fears associated with how other people will react to what you do. For example, being scared that people won't like your work or that they'll judge you for putting yourself out there. In each case, try to internally clarify what your fear is really about and where it's coming from. And in instances where you're still struggling to make sense of what the fear actually is. One strategy I find super helpful is I tell myself, okay, I'm not sure what I'm feeling about this, but if I were to tell myself a story of someone in my similar shoes, what emotion, what fear might they be feeling about this specific thing? And often if you depersonalize the thing, it becomes a lot easier to be like, oh, okay, well, in that world that person will probably feel really scared of like, what other people would think of them. And therefore I'm probably afraid of that as well. All right, so that was the emotion label. Let's move on to experiment number two now. And the idea here is that yes, sometimes our fears are about something very specific, like starting the project or like tarantula or whatever. But a lot of the time our fears are broader than that. They're less about specific problems and they're more about wider identities. And sometimes we give ourselves these labels, like I'm not a runner, or I suck at maths, or like I don't like creative tasks or whatever. And these identities can make us afraid to get started in just the same way that the more specific fears can. Back in the 1960s, psychologist Howard Becker suggested that the labels society places on us profoundly affect the way that we behave. He found that people who are labeled as criminal after a first crime are much more likely to engage in criminal behavior. Again, labels become a self fulfilling prophecy. You have one bad relationship and you conclude that you just aren't any good at relationships at all. You fail one test and you label yourself an academic failure forever. Okay, so Becker called this labeling theory. And he suggested that labels can often become self fulfilling prophecies. And that's why experiment number two is the identity label. The good news is that labeling can also cut the other way. Just as a negative label can amplify our fears, a positive label can overcome them. For example, when I'm experiencing self doubt, a favorite label for myself is lifelong learner. This label highlights my willingness to learn and grow. A lifelong learner would never get stuck in a procrastination rut for long. When you find that you're putting things off, look at the labels you use. Are you over identifying with the problem? And what might be a more positive way to identify someone who works hard, someone who has achieved a lot before, someone who meets their deadlines. If we can change our labels, we can often change our behavior. Now, this might sound like a tiny semantic change, but it really isn't. Like, labels are not just these inert tags that other people place on us. Labels are tools that help us make sense of who we are. And one of the strongest forces in human personality is the need to stay consistent with how we label ourselves and how we define ourselves. So if we can change the label, we can often change the underlying fear. And then we can stop procrastinating and take action on what matters to us. The 10-10-10 rule. One of the reasons fear is so paralyzing is that we tend to catastrophize in our heads. Some minor setback becomes hugely Important Take the you get rejected by someone you like. As a result, you decide that you're not lovable and will spend your life alone. When you catch yourself catastrophizing in this way, try to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The scientific name for this process is cognitive reappraisal, changing the interpretation of a situation so that we feel better emotionally. You can do this by asking yourself the following three questions which add up to what I call the 10-10-10 rule. Will this matter in 10 minutes? Will this matter in 10 weeks? Will this matter in 10 years? Trigger you get rejected by someone you like. Will this matter in 10 minutes? Well, I might still feel a bit down and might not want to show my face to that person. Will this matter in 10 weeks? Maybe, but I'll probably be less upset by then. So much could happen. Will this matter in 10 years? Probably not at all. I'll meet many people between now and then who could completely change my life. The 10-10-10 rule helps us recognize the magnitude of the problem we're stressing out about. Usually we discover that the failures we're worried about now aren't the ones that will always define us, and that the fears we have now won't always carry such significance. Okay, so the example I used here is a little bit of like a high school, college problem. Usually for most people that, oh, I'm worried I'm gonna get rejected by someone I like. But I find that even for people who are like in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s plus, there is always this fear, often this over catastrophized fear of like the negative consequences of making that decision. Like, oh my God, it's so risky, like, I'm going to die, I'm going to end up becoming homeless and alone and whatever. One exercise I've often found that's really helpful for this is Tim Ferriss Fear Setting exercise. If you want to check that out, just Google Tim Ferriss Fear Setting. And it's just like a list of journaling prompts which whenever I have to make any kind of big decision or something that feels particularly scary that I've been procrastinating on for a while, I run through these different prompts and it usually helps me realize that the fear is greater in my mind than it actually is in reality. Experiment number four, the confidence equation. All right, and this is where we are talking about the low grating sense of self doubt. Self doubt is one of the key fears that stands between us and our goals. The fear that we are Just not good enough to do the thing. I often think of this form of self doubt as a kind of suspended animation. Part of us thinks, I really want to do this, but another part says there's no way I can. The result is paralysis. For example, when I procrastinate writing, which is often, it's because I'm suspended between two ideals. On the one hand, there's a genuine desire to write my book, to create something beautiful, to help people, and on the other, there's a little voice in my head saying anything I write is going to be garbage anyway, so there's no point in even doing it. Self confidence equals perception of ability minus perception of standards. If we believe our ability is higher than the standard needed, then we're confident. If we believe our ability is lower than the standard needed, then we're doubtful. What does all this mean for reducing the effects of self doubt? Well, just try asking yourself, could I just get started? Even though I'm feeling unconfident, in most cases, the answer is invariably yes. I don't need to feel like a Schwarzenegger style bodybuilder to work out for an hour. I don't need my first crack at my business strategy to be a work of visionary corporate genius. And I definitely don't need the first draft of my book to be a masterpiece. When you're trying something new, the idea that you should only begin when you feel confident to begin is a blocker all of its own. The solution? Make a start. You won't need to get perfect for a long time yet. I find that this actually tends to be an issue with a lot of smart and successful people. And if you're watching this channel and you've gotten to this point in the video, you are probably a smart and successful person in some areas of your life. But if you're trying to do something new, you're probably, your standards are probably up here because you're used to doing things at a high standard. But your ability is probably here because you have to suck at doing something. Especially if you're new at the thing. You have to suck at it initially in order to get good. But the problem that we high achievers tend to have is that like we're like, oh, I want to be that good from day one. I don't want to be this bad from day one. And so this whole like self doubt thing can really get in the way. One strategy I found super helpful for this, which I got from Oliver Bergman's book 4000 Weeks, which is a very good book is to just lower the bar, just embrace mediocrity. Just like recognize that, you know what? I'm going to suck at this thing. It's okay. The first 100 reps are going to be absolutely God awful. And that's fine. And if we're worried about what people are going to think about that, that takes us to experiment number five, which is to stop spotlighting. We're highly attuned to what others think of us as social creatures. Our amygdala is always on the hunt for threats to our status. But this means that we spend our lives believing a spotlight is always trained on us and that everyone around is constantly looking at us, analyzing our behaviors and passing judgment on our worth as human beings. In a series of papers published in the early 2000s, psychology professor Thomas Gilovich and his co authors proved time and again that individuals have a remarkable tendency to overestimate the degree to which others are thinking about or judging them. People are often anxious about how the tiniest details of their actions and appearance are likely to come across to others. The truth is, everyone is concerned mostly about themselves and how they're coming across. They're not spending much time, if any, thinking about us. What this suggests is that the spotlight effect can be reduced with a simple reminder that, well, no one cares. And when fear is holding you back from doing something, this can be profoundly liberating. No one cares if my first few YouTube videos are terrible and cringy. No one cares if I write blog posts that are a bit rambly because I haven't had much experience of writing. No one cares if I show up to this salsa dancing class as a total beginner without a partner. No one cares if my belt doesn't match my shoes when I attend this party. This mindset of no one cares can be totally transformative. It's one of the simplest methods I've identified to reduce my own anxiety related procrastination. Now, I already think of this as the no one cares muscle. The more you do stuff and find that basically no one actually gives a toss, the more you build this muscle of no one cares and you no longer struggle with the thought of what other people will think of you. And finally, let's move on to experiment number six, the Batman effect. The Batman effect was first identified by a team of researchers led by Professor Rachel White at the University of Pennsylvania. White and her team were curious about whether adopting an alter ego could improve a child's approach to a task. The children were given a task that required them to concentrate and resist the temptation to engage in a more enjoyable activity nearby. One group was given no specific instructions. The second group was asked to reflect on their own feelings and thoughts, and the third group was asked to think of themselves as a superhero or another character they admired. The children who were asked to imagine themselves as superheroes or other characters exhibited significantly better self control, focus, and perseverance than those in the other two groups. When we embody the traits of a fearless, confident alter ego, we can tap into a reservoir of courage and determination that we might not feel our regular selves possess. I find it particularly handy when it comes to speaking in public. Often I'm plagued with insecurity and self doubt, and even though I've been delivering classes and presentations for years, I sometimes feel the fear associated with putting myself out there in this context. My alter ego is young Charles Xavier, AKA Professor X from the X Men series. My physical trigger for stepping into the identity of Charles Xavier is when I put on my fake glasses. That's why I still wear glasses in many public settings even though I've had laser eye surgery. They help me adopt a professional intellectual alter ego that I need to overcome the imposter syndrome I often have when giving a speech. In summary, the solution isn't to get rid of fear. Instead, it's to develop the courage to face up to it. That courage comes from three sources. The first is to understand your fear. Ask yourself, why have I not started on that task or project yet? What am I afraid of? Where does this fear come from? The second is to reduce your fear. Our fears are often blown out of proportion. Ask yourself these questions to prevent yourself from catastrophizing. Will this matter in 10 minutes? Will this matter in 10 weeks? Will this matter in 10 years? And the third is to overcome your fear. If you're scared of what other people think, remind yourself that most people are not in fact thinking about you. We're a self conscious species, but we're not usually a judgmental one. By the way, if you haven't yet read the book or listened to the audiobook, might I suggest giving it a go? It is a very easy listen and it's got some pretty solid reviews as well. All right, so if you liked this video and you'd like to see a similar animated video about the core philosophy behind Feel Good Productivity, which would be interesting if you haven't read the book and actually good revision if you have, then check out that video over there. Thank you very much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next one. Bye.","80-61588: Fear is the overwhelming negative emotion that prevents us from doing things

The video explores how fear underpins procrastination and presents six experiments to overcome it. Host Ali Abdaal shares his seven-year delay in starting YouTube due to fear of judgment, linking procrastination to amygdala-driven anxiety rather than laziness. Strategies include affective labeling, identity reframing, the 10-10-10 rule, and the ""Batman effect,"" emphasizing self-awareness, reduced catastrophizing, and courage-building to act despite fear.  

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:01] Fear is the overwhelming negative emotion that prevents us from doing things**  
Ali introduces fear as the hidden force behind procrastination, sharing his own seven-year delay in launching his YouTube channel due to fear of failure and judgment. He explains the amygdala hijack—the brain’s overreaction to perceived threats (e.g., starting a project)—and contrasts it with real dangers. The chapter establishes fear as the primary obstacle to action, framing procrastination as an emotional rather than motivational issue.  

**[01:01-06:01] Getting to know your fears is the first step towards overcoming procrastination**  
This chapter details the UCLA spider study, where participants who labeled their fears (""affective labeling"") felt less afraid and approached a tarantula more readily. Ali connects this to procrastination, urging viewers to name specific fears (e.g., ""I’m afraid of failure"") instead of rationalizing delays. He suggests asking, ""What am I afraid of?"" and distinguishing ""me reasons"" (self-doubt) from ""them reasons"" (external judgment). Depersonalizing fears by imagining others’ struggles is also recommended.  

**[06:01-10:03] Psychologist Howard Becker says labels profoundly affect the way we behave**  
Ali discusses Becker’s labeling theory, showing how negative self-labels (e.g., ""I’m bad at math"") become self-fulfilling prophecies. Conversely, adopting positive labels (e.g., ""lifelong learner"") can reduce fear and inertia. The chapter emphasizes consistency with self-identity: reframing labels (e.g., ""someone who meets deadlines"") aligns behavior with aspirational traits, leveraging the human need for identity coherence.  

**[10:04-13:57] Self doubt is one of the key fears that stands between us and goals**  
Self-doubt is framed as a conflict between perceived ability and standards. Ali introduces the ""confidence equation"" (confidence = ability perception – standard perception) and advocates starting before feeling ready. High achievers often stall due to mismatched standards (e.g., expecting perfectionism). Strategies include embracing mediocrity initially, referencing Oliver Burkeman’s ""4,000 Weeks,"" and accepting early failures as part of growth.  

**[13:57-16:29] The Batman effect was first identified by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania**  
The ""Batman effect""—adopting an alter ego to boost courage—is illustrated via a study where children pretending to be superheroes showed greater focus. Ali shares using ""Professor X"" as an alter ego during public speaking, with glasses as a physical trigger. This tactic externalizes fear, allowing access to traits like confidence and resilience that feel inaccessible to one’s ""regular"" self.  

Key Points:  
- Fear (of failure, judgment, inadequacy) drives procrastination more than laziness.  
- Labeling fears (""affective labeling"") reduces their emotional grip.  
- Self-identities (labels) shape behavior; positive reframing can combat inertia.  
- Self-doubt stems from unrealistic standards; starting imperfectly builds confidence.  
- The ""Batman effect"" (alter egos) and ""no one cares"" mindset mitigate social anxiety.

Insight/Outlook: By systematically addressing fear through self-awareness, cognitive reframing, and behavioral experiments, individuals can transform procrastination into purposeful action, fostering resilience in both personal and professional pursuits."
audio_9.mp3,"Hey friends, welcome back to the channel and to Create a Club, the ongoing series where we explore strategies to help start and grow and monetize your YouTube channel and or create a business so that you can work towards the three Fs of fun, fulfillment and of course financial freedom. Now in this video I'm going to be sharing some honest advice for someone who wants to start a YouTube channel. Now, whether you have been thinking of starting but haven't yet, or you've sort of started but you're struggling to stay consistent, hopefully there'll be some stuff in this video that can help you out. And if we have not yet met then hello, my name is Ali and I've been making YouTube videos here since 2017 documenting every step of my journey from broke medical student to working as a doctor to now being a seven figure entrepreneur and bestselling author. And since 2020 I've also been running an online community called the part time YouTuber Academy where over 20,000 students have taken our courses on how to start and grow and monetize their YouTube channels with lots of incredible success stories along the way. So if you would like to check out the academy and get all of the systems and templates and processes that I've used to grow this YouTube channel and join a thriving community of creators from all around the world, there are more details in the video description Anyway, in this video we're going to dive into three main parts. Firstly, we're going to understand your motivations and whether they align with the creator first or the business first approach to starting and growing a YouTube channel. Then we're going to talk about how to actually get started with the seven video challenge. And then we're going to end by setting some realistic expectations for the journey ahead and I'll share some practical tips that will hopefully help you stay on track, stay consistent and ultimately have success whatever success means to you. Part 1 Understanding your motivation okay, so the very first thing I would say to someone who's considering starting a YouTube channel is great. You should totally do it. And the main reason for that is that starting and growing a YouTube channel is a fantastic personal growth and spiritual growth and skills based growth journey. Whether or not it ever makes money, it will make something of you. To start and try and grow a YouTube channel. Making videos where you put yourself out on the Internet and to debase yourself in public and dealing with all the emotions associated with that and the fact that people might say mean things and having to overcome imposter syndrome and overthink thinking and Then also learning some of the technical skills around cameras and lights and editing and all that kind of stuff, getting better at presenting to a camera. All of these are incredibly valuable skills that would help anyone in any kind of business or any kind of walk of life. And that's why, partly, I think you should just go for it if you want to start a YouTube channel. But if you and I were having a coffee, for example, and we were talking about you starting a YouTube channel, I would try and dig in and understand your motivations. And this is where the motivation matrix comes in. And the thing we want to understand is that to what extent is your primary motivation for doing YouTube? To what extent is it money and to what extent is it fun? Now, I am simplifying a lot of things by using money and fun. Money could be like, I want to build a business. I want to generate leads for my existing business. You know, ultimately I want to be able to quit my job, et cetera, et cetera, and fun. I'm talking about, you know, creative fulfillment, personal satisfaction, the joy of creation, and the impact and potential fulfillment you can get from helping other people by teaching them stuff on the Internet. So let's first start by getting quadrant number one out of the way. Now, quadrant number one is where your motivation or the result of your YouTube channel is. You make lots of money and also you have a lot of fun. Now, this is obviously the dream life. This is where everyone wants to get to, where you're making money and you are also having fun. But generally, this is not where anyone starts. When you start off your YouTube journey, you do not start off making lots of money, and you generally don't start off having lots of fun. If you are motivated by making lots of money and having lots of fun, then you've got to recognize this is a destination to get to, to aspire to. A destination that you're always going to be working in the direction of rather than the starting point. So there are two viable starting points. Okay, so let's move on to quadrant number two, where your primary motivation for starting a YouTube channel is money. Now, obviously, you still want to have fun because you want to enjoy your life, but fun is not the primary motivation behind why you're doing a YouTube channel. Money is the primary motivation behind why you're doing a YouTube channel. And this would be what I call the business first approach to YouTube. You start off with a business first, and then you start or grow a YouTube channel in order to generate leads and drive traffic to that particular business. If you are taking a business first approach to YouTube, you kind of already need to have some kind of product to sell, some kind of way of making money. And YouTube is purely a marketing vehicle. This is the quadrant that is most suitable for existing business owners. There is a danger zone here. The danger zone is what if your primary motivation for doing YouTube is money, but you are not already a business owner. You do not already have a product to sell. This is where if you and I were having a conversation, I would be encouraging you to think a little bit deeper about this because it is really, really, really, really hard to make money on you. If your primary motivation is money and you're viewing YouTube as a get rich quick or whatever scheme, There are far more efficient ways to make money than doing YouTube. If your goal is to make money and you do not have a product, YouTubers is a gamble. I've been doing YouTube for seven years. I've made over a thousand videos. But if I lost everything, went completely broke, had to get a day job again, like working as a doctor or whatever, and then I was trying to build something on the side where the primary motivation was money. I would not start a YouTube channel, I would start a business. I would build some sort of product. I would find a market for that product. I'd get to the point where I'm making a few thousand dollars or maybe $10,000 a month with the product and then I would use YouTube as an organic content marketing engine for my business. There are people who say, yeah, but what about AdSense and what about brand deals and stuff? And then yeah, again I would say that if the primary goal is to make money, trying to make money directly from YouTube just, it just takes a lot of time. And if the primary motivation is money, you are not going to bother sticking to it for long enough to actually see that money come to fruition. And also, there's no guarantee. If there was a guarantee, everyone, everyone would be a YouTuber and everyone would be rich. And so if you do not already have an existing product or service or business, then your YouTube channel is going to need a lot of time to grow organically. And that is going to need a lot of patience and a lot of consistency and a willingness to create content just for its own sake with absolutely no guarantee of a payoff in the future. And the litmus test for this is, would you do YouTube if you knew you were never ever going to make money from it? This is an interesting question to ask. Would you be an investment banker if you knew you would never make Money from it? Obviously not. No one in their right mind would be an investment banker if they knew they were never going to make money from it. Would you be an accountant if you knew you were never going to make money from it? Obviously not. You'd have to be really weird to want to be an accountant without making money from it. But would you learn the guitar knowing that you're never going to make money from it? Yeah. You can imagine yourself wanting to learn the guitar just for its own sake. You are intrinsically motivated to learn the guitar rather than instrumentally motivated, I. E. By money, to become an investment banker. Would you want to learn a language if you knew you were never going to make money from it? Yeah, why not? Like, it's kind of cool. I want to learn Japanese and Mandarin. My wife speaks Mandarin, so that's kind of cool. I can impress her parents. I want to learn Japanese because I like anime and I can connect with the culture. I have reasons for learning Japanese that are not trying to make money. So for you, your YouTube channel, if you knew it was never going to make money, would you still want to do it? If the answer is no, then it means you're primarily motivated to do a YouTube channel for the money, which again is, I would say, if you're a business owner, fantastic. But if you are not a business owner, please steer clear of YouTube if the primary motivation is money. Okay, so that was quite a number two. Let's move on to quadrant number three. Now, this is where I imagine most people who watch my YouTube channel are at. I'm going to assume that you are. You've got a job of some sort. Maybe you work 9 to 5 as a corporate employee and you kind of like your job, but you don't really like your job that much. And so you vibe with the idea of maybe starting a YouTube channel so that, you know, you like the idea of maybe teaching and sharing educational stuff on the Internet, maybe you like the idea of building a business around it eventually. And you maybe like the idea of potentially someday being able to quit your job. Okay, so if you answered yes to that question of would you do YouTube even if you knew you were never going to make money from it, then you might be in quadrant number three, where your primary motivation for doing YouTube is fun. And this would be what I call the creator first approach, where the goal is to be a creator first and monetize and create a business second. In quadrant number two, the goal is to be a business first and then start weaving in the creator stuff by using YouTube to generate organic content for your, for your business or whatever. But here we are starting out as a YouTuber or a creator first. Most YouTubers who I know who are now successful in the platform and building have built thriving businesses around it, have started off as creators first. They started off making YouTube videos for the joy of it, for the enjoyment, for the passion, for the fulfillment, for the impact that they could potentially have making free videos on the Internet. And over time, as they stayed consistent and as the channels grew, they started getting monetization opportunities through YouTube ads and through brand deals. Maybe some of them eventually built their own products like courses and merch and apps and all that fun stuff. And you can get to this place where you have lots of money and also lots of fun. But you start off as a creator and then you move into that particular quadrant. But the key to the creator first approach is that you've got to want to do it even if you weren't going to make money from it. So if you were to, for example, make one video every single week for the next two years, I can guarantee that your life will change. I cannot guarantee how much money you're going to make, but I can 100 guarantee that your life will change. At the very least, you'll learn valuable skills, you'll overcome some emotional hurdles, it'll be an exercise in personal and spiritual development, and you might make a bunch of friends along the way as well. And then obviously, if you don't want money and you don't want to have fun While growing a YouTube channel, I would be asking the question, well then why do you want to grow a YouTube channel? Maybe you want to do it for like non profit reasons where you're like grinding away and trying to make videos even though it's not going to make any money because you care about impact. But the key thing, I would say is that the thing that makes a YouTube channel sustainable is you enjoying the process of doing it. This is why it's difficult to succeed on YouTube. If you are money motivated, but you don't have a way of making money because for the first year or two or three or sometimes even five of making YouTube videos where you're not making any money, it will suck all of the motivation and joy out of you. And if you're not enjoying the process, it's just never going to happen. So please, I would avoid trying to start a YouTube channel if you're not intending to make money from it. And also you don't intend to have fun doing it along the way now, as we talked about, business owners start with the business first approach and then eventually become this dream life creator preneur, as I call it, where you're an entrepreneur but you're also a creator. And you know, that's kind of where I am right now, thankfully. But a lot of people will start creator first where they start making YouTube videos and stuff for the fun, the fulfillment and the joy of the craft. And over time we'll find a way to monetize that. And that is the creator first approach to building a YouTube channel. And so if you and I were having a conversation, I'd really be trying to understand the motivations behind it. And of course I would be trying to discourage you from attempting to use YouTube as a money making opportunity when you don't already have a business around the thing and this video is getting very long. But that's okay. It's fine. If you're here with me, then you're probably the sort of person who would vibe with the way that I teach stuff. Anyway, I'm not going to try any of this retention, editing and all this shit to try and keep you engaged to the video. If you don't want to stick around, that's totally fine. Anyway, I'm just using that as a note for myself because when you become a YouTuber or if you're a YouTuber, as you will know, there's always this thing in the back of your mind of like, oh, should I do this thing? Like, what if the audience drops off the video? What if my retention plummets and what if I look at my graph and like I need to make it more engaging and stuff. But you know, a big part of building a YouTube channel that you actually enjoy is doing what you want in it and trying to, then trying to that, trying to align that to your business goals rather than to chase something like views or engagement or retention or any of this stuff. Anyway, side point, I have a bit of a story to tell this. So it's not much story, but most people think if you've been following my channel for any length of time, most people think that I started out creator first that, oh, he was a doctor and they're a medical student and then he was a doctor and then while working full time as a doctor and stuff, he started the YouTube channel and was making YouTube videos and eventually the YouTube channel grew and then the money started rolling in and he became a millionaire and all this sort of stuff. It's not actually true. I actually started YouTube with a business first approach to it. And the first business that I had was called 6med, and it was a company that was helping people get into medical school. So I'd be traveling up and down the country here in the uk. I also taught a course in Singapore and one in the Netherlands. And I was teaching people how to prepare for the bmat, which used to be a medical school entrance exam, to get you into, like, Oxford and Cambridge University and Imperial and UCL and a few other medical schools. And that was how I made money. When I was in medical school, I was making like £40,000, $50,000 a year profit from that business. So that basically funded my entire university experience, which was awesome. But around 2017, we started to stall in terms of business growth. And I reasoned that, like, wait a minute, why don't I start a YouTube channel and make educational content about getting into med school? Because if enough people watch that, hopefully some of them will think I'm a legit guy and will sign up to my course. The primary motivation was actually money. There was part. There was a big part of me that was like, oh, it'd just be cool to be a YouTuber, because I've been wanting to be a YouTuber since, like 2010. And I sort of had a few false starts with like, music videos and stuff. You can see them on the channel if you like. But really the reason I started my YouTube channel was because I wanted to increase the amount of leads I was getting to my business. And I did manage to increase the amount of leads I was getting to my business. But then very quickly I realized, actually, this YouTube thing is more fun than actually running this business. So then in 2019, I sold that business. I'm still very slightly involved with it. And actually, if I didn't start YouTube with a business first approach, if I was making no money at all for the first year, which I wasn't, I, like, lost money for my. For the first year of 90 videos of growing on YouTube, it would have been hard to keep going. It would have been hard to have the motivation to keep going if I didn't know that, like, okay, for every. Every view that any of my med school videos gets, there is a slightly increased chance that someone might sign up to one of my courses. And that was the thing that I was using to make money to fund my med school experience. Now, to be clear, there is nothing wrong with doing the creator first approach. That there's nothing wrong with doing the business first approach. But I don't want you guys, I don't Want you to think that, oh, Ali Abdal succeeded by just starting a YouTube channel and just randomly talking about random shit and then eventually it blew up. It was actually quite a strategic decision based on driving leads to my business. So if you are a business owner and you're still here, then fantastic. You know, a YouTube channel is a much more guaranteed path to success if you have a business on the back end. Because now you can be super niche with your content. You can just target exactly your icp, your ideal customer profile. You can make content that really appeals to them and then you can do call to actions that say, hey, if you want to sign up to my med school admissions course or hey, if you want to sign up to my marketing agency or whatever. The thing is, you can drive traffic directly to the thing. Honestly, to be honest, it is not in my interest to tell you this. I make money. I make millions every year from teaching people how to, how to start and grow YouTube channels. I would probably be able to double my income if I leaned heavily into the messaging that you right now. You can, if you start a YouTube channel, you'll be able to quit your job and make money. There's all sorts of people who are teaching you how to quit your job and make money on the Internet. Everyone wants to do that. You can charge extortionate amounts of money for online courses and systems and stuff if you just tell people you can make money from this thing. And it's in my interest to tell you that, hey, if you want to make money, you should start a YouTube channel. But I'm going against my commercial interests here and I'm just telling you it is really, really hard to grow on YouTube if your primary motivation is money, if you are not enjoying the process. And the reason I'm going on about this so much is because I have dozens and dozens and dozens of conversations every single year with people who I know in real life and some people I don't know in real life. You know, someone comes up to me on the street and they say, do you want to grab a coffee? And I'm like, yeah, I'm free. Why not? So many people want to start YouTube channels. And I, I spend a lot of time trying to talk people out of viewing YouTube as a get rich quick scheme. Unless you already have a business, obviously. Caveat. Trying to talk people out of viewing YouTube as a get rich quick scheme and trying to encourage people to focus on the joy and the satisfaction and the fulfillment and the learning of skills and the personal growth that you get from starting a YouTube channel, trying to get people to do it for a reason other than money. This has gone on for a very long time. But if you're watching this video and you're thinking of starting a growing YouTube channel and you have money in the back of your mind, please let it be the one thing you take away from this bloody video. Do not try and do YouTube if the primary goal is money. If you actually find a way to enjoy the craft of making videos and you focus on being of service, being creating valuable content that will hopefully help people. And if you're watching this, then hopefully you think that, you know, this video is kind of helping you in some way. Focusing on creating valuable content that might help people and focusing on enjoying the journey along the way. You are way more likely to actually make money from your YouTube channel compared to if you have a primary goal of making money from your YouTube channel and you don't already have a business around it. And now you're just going to be firing blanks. You're going to be struggling with consistency, you're going to be having to use discipline, you're going to be trying to whip yourself every time you haven't made a video because you have this excess extrinsic motivation that's driving you to do the thing. And extrinsic motivation is way less powerful than the intrinsic motivation that you get. The joy of the craft, the joy of creation, the joy of being able to help people. Please, please, please, please do not do YouTube just for the money, for goodness sake. This is, I'm getting super passionate about this. This is kind of fun. Okay, now at this point, if you are a business and you know that you want to do YouTube for the money to drive leads to your business, you should 100% sign up for our YouTuber Academy. We'll, we'll just save you time along the way. And we really help business owners drive more leads to their business and make more money and all that kind of stuff. But if you're not, then the rest of this video is going to be for you, hopefully. Part two, the seven Video Challenge. Okay, so here's the thing. If you are watching this far, you're probably thinking of starting a YouTube channel. And the biggest thing that holds people back is just not actually doing the thing. In my case, I've been wanting to start a YouTube channel since 2010, and it was only really when I had the money thing focused on driving late for my business that I actually managed to succeed with it or actually managed to start It. But it took me, like, seven years to make my first YouTube video because I spent so much time overthinking and thinking I needed the right camera and the right microphone. And then seven years later, eventually I managed to get a friend of mine called Dranka to sing on camera. And I wasn't even in that video. I was like, I was so shy about showing myself on camera that I was behind the camera filming my friends singing songs for me. Video number, like six or seven was when I was on camera playing the guitar with my friend Catherine while she was singing. And then the next video I made was a video where I was singing, and that was my first time actually speaking to a camera. And it was really scary. And I'd actually unlisted that video for, like, seven years because I was embarrassed. It got like, five views and it got three dislikes. Three dislikes and five views. And I was so demotivated, I was like, you know what? You know, I've been trying to be a music YouTuber for the last seven years, and now, seven years later, I've finally plucked up the courage to put myself on camera and sing a freaking song, and I've got five views and three discs dislikes. So I unlisted that video so no one could see it. And it was only a couple of months ago that I remembered that I unlisted that video and I just put it public again because now it's just kind of fun. It's not. It's fun now that I'm a big YouTuber and people look to me for YouTube advice to see, you know, my shitty singing, not knowing anything about cameras and stuff, and the fact that I felt so bad about that video that I chose to unlist it for years. Anyway, all this to say is that I have seen this pattern play out in myself, and I've seen this pattern play out in a lot of people I've seen where, honestly, if you're watching this part in the video and you haven't yet started your YouTube channel, I imagine you didn't just think about it, right? I imagine you've been thinking maybe for some time, maybe even for years, maybe even for over a decade, that, hey, it'll be cool to start a YouTube channel. Maybe you have. Most people I speak to have been thinking about it for months, if not years, before they finally take that plunge. And so the seven video challenge is that I would implore you to stop watching videos like this, stop overthinking, and just make your first seven videos. Seven is the magic. Number no. 1 starts off being perfect from day one. Seven is the magic number, because once you've actually made seven videos, you have a way better sense of how it, how the process actually works. Now, I'm going to tell you another story here which may or may not be relevant to this, but actually, I think. I think it's kind of relevant. So back when I was in medical school, I, you know, we had to learn how to save lives by doing cpr, you know, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and following kind of this life support algorithm where, you know, like in TV shows and stuff, when someone's heart stops and it's like. And then everyone comes in and like, you know, the chest compressions and then they take the bzz clear and then, you know, all of, all of that kind of stuff. So I'd seen that shit in like, Grey's Anatomy Forever. Obviously, everyone has seen that on tv. And when I got to med school, I was really excited to learn about this. And, you know, for the first three years of med school out of six, we just do a lot of science and a lot of theory. And then my fourth year, it was like, finally time to go into the hospitals and see what this stuff would be like in real life. Now I was, I was like, I'm going to save all the lives, right? I'm going to save all the lives. I'm going to learn how to do the thing. And I spent ages reading about how to do CPR and watching videos about it and reading lecture notes about it and speaking to people about it. And nothing could have possibly prepared me for the moment where I was involved in a cardiac arrest scenario myself. Nothing could have prepared me for that. All of the reading, all the watching, all of that shit, it just was. I was like, oh, okay, this is what it actually is in real life. I understand now. It's like I'd been using this tiny percentage of my brain capacity or like, capacity to like, understand the thing, and having the experience of it made me think, ah, okay, I get it now. And then when I started reading and watching and distinctive stuff and understanding the algorithms and like, you know, the dose of adrenaline and like, you know, which cardiac rhythm is the heart end, you know, whatever, it all suddenly started to make sense. The reason I'm using this example is because it's the same thing with YouTube videos. You can read and overthink and analyze and watch all the tutorials all you want about making videos, but unless you've made a few videos, you are Missing out on a huge amount of context that your brain and body will otherwise have around the process of creating YouTube videos. So that's why the thing I would say is pause this video right now and just make your first YouTube video. You can literally just open up the YouTube app on your phone, you can hit record and you can just do a video talking to the camera where you're like, hey, I'm starting a YouTube channel. And actually, if you look back to my first vlog, that's basically what I did. I was lying on the bed holding up my iPhone and that was my first vlog because I knew that if I didn't take action there and then it was not going to happen and I'd be overthinking it. So the key thing is to actually start taking the action and actually making the videos. And by the time you've made about seven, you have a lot of context of what it takes to make YouTube videos. And crucially, you have a lot of context about whether you actually enjoy it. The point I made earlier was that if you don't enjoy making YouTube videos, it's just not going to like, you're just not going to stay consistent with it. This is not the sort of thing that you want to rely on discipline for. You're going to get some bros in the comments being like, oh, screw this guy. You're saying you need to enjoy the thing like discipline. Good luck. None of those people have YouTube channels. Because it's really, really, really hard to sustain any kind of habit unless you enjoy the process. And you won't know whether you're going to enjoy the process until you made those first few. I think seven is a good number, this first seven videos. So the thing that I would encourage you to do from this video is to give yourself a seven video challenge where you challenge yourself to just make seven videos. They can be about whatever the hell you want, but you're challenging yourself to make seven videos. And then along the way you can sure watch the tutorials and overthink about the thing and take my course and all that kind of stuff. But you got to make the seven videos if you're interested in doing this as part of a community challenge. We actually have a seven video challenge as part of our part time YouTuber Foundations course. Basically the idea is that you pay $297 and you take our little course where we give you prompts for all these seven videos. But if you actually take action and make the seven videos, we will refund every penny you've paid for the course. You get the course for free. You get the challenge for free. If you actually do the work. You want to be a YouTuber, right? You could probably make seven videos in the next seven months. And if you can't, then you're definitely not going to make it as a YouTuber. But having a little bit of accountability, having that little push and having a community of other YouTubers from around the world, including me and my team, kind of helping out along the way to help support you in that journey might be helpful. And like I said, you pay $297, you complete seven videos in seven months, and we will refund every single penny. So you get the whole thing for free. When you get to seven, video number seven and beyond video number seven, at that point, you have to make a decision. Decision. If you've seen my previous videos on how to grow on YouTube, you know, you know what's coming. Part three, what is your relationship with YouTube? Basically, I have a whole framework for growing on YouTube. We've got level one, we've got level two, and we've got level three. Level one is get going. Level two is get good and consistent, and level three is get smart. So level one is kind of your first seven videos. And the goal there is to just get going, to not overthink it. You don't need to worry about your niche. For the record, everyone's always like, what niche that I have? You can just make seven videos about whatever the hell you want. And in our challenge, we're going to give you prompts for those seven videos, so you don't need to think about it. We want to be thinking about our niche a little bit sort of further down the line. But when you get to this cross point between level one and level two, once you've made your first seven videos, now you have to ask yourself a question, which is, what sort of relationship do I want with YouTube? Do I want a casual relationship with my YouTube channel, or do I want a committed relationship? Now, a casual relationship is one where you make videos whenever you feel like it. You make videos when it's convenient to you. You're bored on a Friday night and you say, hey, you up and you hit record on the camera and you make a video randomly. When you're free on a Friday night, you're probably not free on a Friday night. Maybe you are, who knows? But you have a casual relationship with YouTube, right? That kind of thing. A committed relationship is one where you show up even when you don't feel like It's a committed relationship is one where you're like, you know what, I'm going to do a date night once a week or twice a week and I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to commit to seeing you regularly. I'm going to commit to publishing and uploading videos regularly. Regularly can be as regular as you like. Some YouTubers succeed by publishing once a month. Some YouTubers succeed By publishing once every three months. It's a lot harder to succeed publishing once every three months because now every single video has to be a freaking banger, which is really hard to do. I personally recommend once a week, once every two weeks if you're really busy and you really can't make the time to do videos, but you want to commit to some sort of schedule. If you're really going to take this stuff seriously and if you don't have a committed relationship with YouTube, then, you know, you can't really expect to be able to build a business around it. You can't really expect to make money. You can still have fun with a casual relationship. From what I hear, casual relationships can be fun, but really the depth and joy you get from a committed relationship, I would know now that I'm married is like nothing that you would get from casual relationships. Similar thing with YouTube. Yes, you can have fun making YouTube videos every now and then. But if you really want YouTube to be able to change your life, like in the way it's done for me and a bunch of other people that I know, where you get into that dream quadrant where you're making a shit ton of money and also having a lot of fun, it needs to be a committed relationship. Part four the five Cs of YouTube success. I have these five Cs for building a YouTube channel. Well, underneath that, the first C is courage. It takes a lot of courage to start a YouTube channel. And it constantly takes courage to show up even when you don't feel like it, deal with negative comments, all that kind of stuff. Deal with your own imposter syndrome and overthinking and emotional hurdles that are holding you back. It takes courage to feel all those feelings and do it anyway. So courage is the first C. The second one is consistency. It takes a lot of consistency to see any kind of growth on YouTube. If you are not consistent on YouTube, it's very difficult for YouTube to change your life. Yes, there are examples of people who have succeeded without being consistent. My wife and one of our former students of our part time YouTuber Academy is actually One of them, she's only made about 50 videos in the last three years. It's not very consistent. She's been very sporadic with it, but her YouTube channel has blown up, mostly because she has a lot of value to teach when it comes to doing videos about learning Mandarin and really focuses on the quality of her videos. So, yes, you can sort of maybe succeed without being consistent. But I can count on one hand the number of youtubers I know who have succeeded without being consistent. And I know dozens, dozens and dozens of dozens of YouTube of YouTubers who succeed with while being consistent. So consistency is the second thing. The third thing is clarity. And this is where you have clarity about who you're trying to go after. Like what your videos are actually about, who's the target audience, what's the value proposition? What are your competitive advantages in the space? Why should they, why should people care about watching your videos, Commit to other people's videos? This is also kind of the stuff we want to be thinking about once we've already made our first seven videos. Once we're beyond that get going stage, at that point, we can now worry about, like, okay, cool, how, like, what videos should I actually make? Then, of course, we have content, the content itself. In order to grow on YouTube, your videos have to actually be good. And there is an enormous list of things that we need to do to try and make our videos better over time. There is writing this, scripting, there's filming, there's like set design, there's audio design, there's editing. There's like the proof of work that goes into the video itself. There's how much research that goes into it. There's your Persona and presence on camera. If you have a channel where you show your face, there's like dozens and dozens of these things. And over time, time, the idea is that as you keep on making these videos with a bedrock of consistency, without consistency, none of this actually works. But, well, my voice broke there. I'm just super passionate about this topic. Without consistency, none of this is going to work. But as you keep on making videos on your whatever cadence of consistency you've decided works best for you, whether it's once a week or twice a week or once a month. The goal is that with each video, you're trying to improve one thing about it slightly. You know, the whole thing of, like, make 1% improvements over time. The mistake that I see a lot of people make is that they focus on the improvements and they sacrifice the consistency. But you cannot be. In the early days of a YouTube channel, you cannot be sacrificing quantity for the sake of quality. But once you've got this bedrock of consistency and you have a bit of a sense of who you're actually making videos for and what's the point in, I guess, your niche, then we want to be thinking about how do we make the content as good as possible. And then finally, the final king bit of this process is C4 cash. This is the first 5th C. If you're interested in diving more into details about these five C's I have a completely free training webinar where I explored all these in like a whole hour, where I give a bunch of stories and a bunch of practical tips on how to build up these five Cs over time that will also be linked down below if you want to check it out. It is completely free. And so whatever Your approach to YouTube is, whether it's business first or creator first, or whether you're like, I really want to make money from this, or whether you're like, I just want to kind of have fun, it's still kind of useful to understand the framework and the roadmap for how to succeed on YouTube. I say how to succeed on YouTube. This is, you know, there's no one size fits all approach here. Again, it's not in my commercial interest to say this, but I don't have all of the answers. With my course and with these YouTube videos and with everything that I do on my channel, I think of myself as a guide rather than a guru. My goal is to just share whatever's worked for me and what I've seen work for people that I know and what I've seen work for my students. I'm not saying it's the perfectly right answer for you. I'm not saying these five Cs are the only way you can possibly simply succeed on YouTube. I'm saying they've worked for me. It's a good framework that's worked. It's worked for a bunch of my students. If you look at my website, you can see a bunch of reviews from students, including some pretty big high profile people that we've had as alumni of the part time YouTuber Academy. It's a framework that works for a lot of people. But of course a big part of succeeding on YouTube is that you've got to take these frameworks and these sort of principles that other people are teaching you and you've got to apply them to your own life and your own channel. Maybe you don't have a talking head educational channel, which means some of the stuff that I say about building a brand or scripting and all this kind of stuff might not work for you. That's okay. It's sort of like you learn from what other people are doing and you take the bits that vibe with you, that resonate with you, that work with your values and what you actually personally want from your YouTube channel, and you apply them to your own creative business. Okay, this video has gone on for long enough, but if you want to see more details about this, like, three part framework and exactly what I would do if I was starting a YouTube channel from scratch today, check out this video over here and that will give you way more detail. Thank you so much for getting to the end of this enormous video and hopefully I will see you in the next one.

### Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:26] This video explores strategies to help start, grow, and monetize your YouTube channel**  
Ali introduces the video’s purpose: sharing honest advice for aspiring YouTubers, whether they’re beginners or struggling with consistency. He briefly shares his journey from medical student to seven-figure entrepreneur and creator of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy. The video is structured into three parts: understanding motivations, the ""7 Video Challenge,"" and practical tips for success.  

**[01:26-02:53] Starting and growing a YouTube channel is fantastic personal growth and spiritual growth**  
Ali argues that starting a YouTube channel accelerates personal and skill-based growth, even if it never monetizes. The process builds resilience, technical skills (editing, presenting), and emotional maturity by facing criticism and imposter syndrome. He highlights the value of YouTube as a transformative journey regardless of financial outcomes.  

**[02:53-03:29] Your motivation or the result of your YouTube channel is based on two quadrants**  
Ali introduces the ""motivation matrix,"" comparing money-driven (business-first) vs. fun-driven (creator-first) approaches. Quadrant 1 (money + fun) is the ideal end goal, but most start in Quadrant 2 (business-first) or Quadrant 3 (creator-first). He warns against starting YouTube purely for money without an existing business, calling it a risky gamble.  

**[03:29-05:39] Your primary motivation for starting a YouTube channel is money**  
Quadrant 2 (business-first) suits existing business owners using YouTube as a marketing tool. Ali cautions against this approach for non-business owners, noting YouTube’s unpredictability and time-intensive nature. He stresses extrinsic motivation (money) is unsustainable without immediate returns and advises focusing on intrinsic joy instead.  

**[05:39-06:47] Would you do YouTube if you knew it never made money**  
Ali poses a litmus test: if money weren’t a factor, would you still create? He contrasts instrumental careers (e.g., investment banking) with intrinsically rewarding hobbies (e.g., learning guitar). For YouTube to be sustainable, creators must prioritize fulfillment over financial gain, especially in early stages.  

**[06:47-10:31] Most YouTubers who have built successful businesses have started as creators first**  
Quadrant 3 (creator-first) focuses on passion and impact. Successful creators often start by making free content, later monetizing through ads, sponsorships, or products. Ali emphasizes consistency and enjoying the process, noting that even two years of weekly videos guarantee personal growth, if not income.  

**[10:31-15:55] Ali Abdal started YouTube with a business first approach**  
Ali shares his origin story: he launched YouTube to promote his medical school prep business (6med). While initially money-driven, he transitioned to creator-first after selling the business. He warns against viewing YouTube as a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme unless paired with an existing product or service.  

**[15:55-22:32] Part two, the seven Video Challenge**  
Ali urges viewers to stop overthinking and start creating. The ""7 Video Challenge"" helps overcome inertia by forcing action. He compares YouTube to learning CPR—theory is insufficient without practice. Making seven videos builds context, tests enjoyment, and reveals whether consistency is feasible.  

**[22:32-25:01] I have a whole framework for growing on YouTube**  
Ali outlines his three-level framework: ""Get Going"" (first 7 videos), ""Get Good & Consistent"" (commitment), and ""Get Smart"" (optimization). He advises against niche obsession early on and stresses gradual improvement over perfection.  

**[25:01-27:46] Do you want a casual relationship with YouTube or a committed relationship**  
Ali contrasts casual (sporadic uploads) vs. committed (scheduled consistency) approaches. While casual creators can have fun, committed creators achieve long-term growth and monetization. He recommends weekly or biweekly uploads for serious aspirants.  

**[27:46-29:42] Part four: the five Cs of YouTube success includes courage, clarity, and consistency**  
The 5 Cs:  
1. **Courage** to face criticism and self-doubt.  
2. **Consistency** to build momentum.  
3. **Clarity** on audience, niche, and value proposition.  
4. **Content quality** through incremental improvements.  
5. **Cash** (monetization strategies). Ali offers a free webinar detailing these principles.  

**[29:42-...] C4 cash is the framework for how to succeed on YouTube**  
Ali reiterates the 5 Cs and advises tailoring frameworks to individual goals. He positions himself as a guide, not a guru, and encourages viewers to apply principles flexibly. The video concludes with a call to action for his free training and related content.

audio_10.mp3,"This book, the Almanac of Naval Ravikant, is one of the best books I have ever read about financial freedom. And in this episode of Book Club, which is the ongoing series where for the last five years I've been distilling and discussing highlights and summaries from some of my favorite books, we are going to be talking about the five key components of the financial freedom equation. All right, so the first key idea from the book is to find and build specific knowledge. Now this is probably the thing that is most confusing about the stuff that Naval writes in that, like, what is specific knowledge? Well, here is what he says in the book about what specific knowledge is. He writes, specific knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. Secondly, he says specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Thirdly, building specific knowledge will feel like play to you, but will look like work to others. Fourth, when specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not schools. And five, specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. And the way that I understand the concept of specific knowledge is that it's this combination of knowledge and skills that is somewhat unique to you. So Naval writes that when I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn't even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know. An example that Naval uses is maybe you had an obsessive personality. You dive into things and remember them quickly. Or maybe you have a love for science fiction. You are into reading sci fi, which means you absorb a lot of knowledge very quickly. Maybe you play a lot of games, so you understand game theory pretty well. And if I use myself as an example, there were broadly three things that I was kind of super into when I was a kid and a teenager. The first one was reading a of books. The second one was trying to build stuff. So this was like Legos and like airplane models when I was a kid, and then like websites and like web developmenty type, like trying to tinker away and build things. And the third thing is that I always really, really liked teaching. I would always be teaching students who were younger than me or students in the class who would ask me for help and stuff like that. And teaching is something that came very naturally to me and I found myself effortlessly drawn to it. Now, Naval would probably call this combination of factors some kind of specific knowledge. And in the intersection of these things like reading a lot of books and enjoying teaching and enjoying building stuff that has sort of morphed into this career that I've stumbled into where I make videos and I write books and I like do reviews of books and stuff like that. But I didn't get here by setting out 20 years ago to become a YouTuber doing productivity stuff and writing self help books. It was more a case of pursuing what I was genuinely interested in and curious about rather than by trying to find the most efficient way to learn a skill that can make money or whatever that might be, namal writes. Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It's not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job. It's not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest. All right, so one of the things we're going to talk about later in this video is the concept of leverage and the concept of media based leverage. And that is where the sponsor of this video comes in, which is Riverside. Riverside is your all in one online studio for video and podcasting, both recording and editing, and it makes it incredibly easy to create high quality content right from your browser. I absolutely love Riverside. I've been using it for years to record podcasts and remote interviews super easily. It's super easy to use and it integrates really nicely into our workflow for video and podcast production. And the great thing about Riverside is that it's built specifically for creators like us. Not only does it let me record in up to 4K, but the editing features are really good and save a ton of time as well. For example, with multi track editing we can adjust individual tracks, mute certain parts, or even add scenes automatically. And the AI producer is incredibly helpful. When I do podcasts with me and my brother, we don't want to deal with all the faff of having to manually edit things and so you just click a button and the AI automatically removes silences and switches, camera angles and everything and it's just absolutely incredible. Oh, and the AI producer also adds perfectly animated captions to your videos, which is fantastic, especially if you're doing short form content that has like the captions baked in. Now, if you want to try out Riverside, here is a special offer just for you. The first 1,000 people to click the link in the video description and use my coupon code will get three months of Riverside Pro completely for free. That is exclusive access to all of their pro features for three months for absolutely no cost at all. So if you are ready to take your content creation to the next level and get your media based leverage, which is one of the things we're going to talk about, then definitely check out the Riverside using the link below. Absolutely love Riverside, been using it for years, will continue to use it for years. And thank you so much Riverside for sponsoring this video. And so if you're at this point in the video, the question you could be asking yourself is what could my own specific knowledge be? And there's a few different ways of thinking about this. So firstly, you can think about internal versus external motivation. You want to ask yourself what are the sorts of things I am internally intrinsically motivated to learn more and find out more about. This could, for example, be the difference between someone who, when they were a kid or a teenager would take apart computers for fun versus someone who learns to code because they've heard that tech pays really well. So when you're internally motivated to do stuff, then it's probably stuff that you would be reading about in your spare time or maybe talking about that thing with friends maybe a bit too much. And it's probably the thing that you would find yourself drawn to even if you weren't getting paid for it. Now if you compare this to external motivation, that's when you're following market trends like hey, I hear AI agents are really hot right now. So let me build an interest in AI agents and you'll have a sense of constantly checking whether the thing is profitable yet. This is like the difference between someone who starts a YouTube channel because they love the idea of personal self expression versus someone who starts a YouTube channel because they think it'll make them money. And if you're in that category where you're only starting a YouTube channel because you think it'll make you money, then you're constantly going to be checking to see have I made money yet? Have I made money yet? Money yet. And and given that it takes ages to make money and it's not even guaranteed, chances are, if you are chasing, starting a YouTube channel or any kind of skill because you see the money on the other end of the thing, chances are you won't stick to it long enough for it to actually work. And you probably won't enjoy it very much either, which means you will be out competed if it's a zero sum game by people who genuinely do enjoy the thing. Secondly, you can think of building specific knowledge in the sense of process versus outcome. Are you focused on the process or are you focused on the outcome? And generally the vibe is that if you're building specific knowledge, that is things that you can't be trained for, things that are found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion, if you're genuinely leaning into your own natural inclinations, then chances are you'll get lost in the process rather than being fixated on the outcome. And thirdly, something that Naval often talks about in interviews is that if you're looking for specific knowledge, you want to be looking at what are the intersections or the unusual or unique combinations that are specific to you. And true, valuable, specific knowledge often comes from combining interests in a way that might seem strange to other people at first. Like if we take someone like Joe Rogan, for example, he starts off as a comedian and then he gets into fighting, and then he gets into like commentating on like martial arts fights and stuff. And then he develops a skill to just have a conversation with anyone. And then he starts a podcast, which ends up becoming like one of the biggest podcasts in the world. But this combination of like comedian plus fighter plus commentator plus interviewer, that's kind of an interesting combination that not many people in the world have. Or if you look at Naval Ravikant himself, like there are thousands and thousands of investors out there, but Naval is one of the most well known, not because he is a particularly good investor, but because he combines the investing entrepreneurial stuff with philosophizing on Twitter and writing essays and these tweet storms about stuff like this, like wealth and happiness and health and how to how to get rich without getting lucky. And it's this combination of the philosophizing with the investing thing that leads to an interesting combination that makes Naval much more well known than most other investors who maybe specialize just in the investing component. Again, what this is trying to get at is that if you really want to become wealthy, if you want to be financially free, don't just follow the previously pre trodden path. Because if there was genuinely a path that you could literally just, you know, stack the blocks and like follow the path to a T and then that would get you rich. Everyone would already be doing that and that would be priced into the amount of money you can make from the thing. And so, to round off this section, here are a couple of prompts that can help you think about finding your own specific knowledge. Firstly, what do you do on weekends that feels like play to you, but looks like work to other people? Secondly, what topics make you lose track of time when you're learning about them? Thirdly, what unique combinations of interests do you have that seem unrelated? And four, what do your friends constantly ask your advice about? All of these are different ways of getting at what could your specific knowledge be to find within yourself innately and then to build upon that. But having specific knowledge alone isn't enough if you want to build wealth or if you want to build financial freedom without getting lucky. There's all sorts of people out there, like researchers and developers and people with deep, deep unique expertise, who haven't achieved financial freedom because they're missing the other components of this little financial freedom equation. And that brings us on to component number two, which is accountability. Now, as it relates to accountability, what Naval says is, embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. Naval writes, we are socially hardwired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power. So this is the first aspect of accountability that he talks about, this ability to actually take risks under your own personal name. Now, in most industries, the people who are making the most money are most likely the people whose names are out there and whose names themselves are on the line. If we take the industry of medicine, for example, like, you could totally make a reasonable a living as a doctor where no one really knows who your name is other than your employer. And like, you know, you introduce yourself to your patients. But within medicine, the doctors who tend to make the most money tend to be the ones who are taking risks under their own personal name. They are building a personal brand for themselves. They're putting themselves out there. Maybe they're getting really good at orthopedic surgery. And so they're known as, like, the best orthopedic surgeon in New York. And so patients are actively seeking out that individual rather than saying, hey, I'm going to go to this hospital because this hospital is really good, and I'll just be paired with whatever surgeon happens to be working on the day. Again, that's totally fine. And for most doctors, the goal of becoming wealthy is not really the primary goal they're working towards, but the doctors who tend to be the wealthiest. And that's what we're talking about here, financial freedom, how to build wealth. They tend to be the ones taking risks under their own personal name, building their own personal brand, taking accountability without hiding behind a brand or an institution. Why do companies sell themselves to Berkshire Hathaway? It's not because they care intrinsically about Berkshire Hathaway. They care about Warren Buffett because Warren Buffett has built a strong personal brand, professional reputation, credibility around his own name. And therefore people want to do business with Warren Buffett because he's built this credibility for being a fair guy, for, like, holding onto stuff forever, for, like, not really interfering with the business. And that's one form of accountability in that you are putting your name to things. But another form of accountability that Naval talks about in the book is being accountable for your outputs rather than your inputs. So what does this mean? Well, for the most part, if you are, for example, an employee, you tend to be accountable for your inputs in that your job is to show up and put in the hours. Fundamentally, the employer is buying your time, and the employer is hoping that as a result of that time, certain outputs will get produced and those outputs will drive certain outcomes for the business or for the customers or whatever. But fundamentally, you're accountable for your inputs. The problem with being accountable for your inputs is that your time and value and work and how much you get paid is generally quite annoyingly correlated. Then you've got level two where you are accountable for your outputs. Now, in this context, you could imagine someone being, let's say, a freelance writer. Now, if you're a freelance writer and you're getting paid per article you produce, suddenly you're accountable for your outputs rather than your inputs. The client does not really care how long it takes you to write that article, as long as you produce the article. And therefore you have decorrelated the amount of time you're putting into the thing with the amount of value you're creating and the amount of money you can get paid for doing the thing. But then you've got level three where you're accountable for outcomes. Now, again, if we use the example of, let's say a freelance writer, being accountable for inputs might be being paid per hour for writing a sales page. Being accountable for outputs might be being able to charge, I don't know, $5,000 for a draft of a sales page. But being accountable for outcomes, that would be level three of accountability, might be saying to the client, hey, don't pay to actually do the work of creating the sales page, but anytime this sales page makes more money than your previous one did, I want 20% of the upside. That is where you are accountable for the outcome. Now, as you go up this accountability spectrum from input to output to outcome, you as an individual end up taking on more and more risk, but the rewards also get higher and higher. And as you go up this accountability spectrum, as well, you also end up spending more time sweating at night if things are not working out. This is also what Naval means by taking accountability. In this capitalist world that we live in, the greatest rewards go to the people who take the greatest risks. Now, in a world where you're being employed by a business and being paid an hourly rate, you're unlikely to get very rich off of that, even if it's a very high hourly rate, because the business, and by extension the business owner are the ones taking on the risk of being accountable for outputs and for outcomes. You're simply being paid an hourly wage to hopefully generate some outputs and hopefully generate some outcomes. But you're not really going to capture the value that you've created because you're not taking on the risk. He does write that accountability is a double edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly. He writes, in the old days, the captain was expected to go down with the ship. If the ship was sinking, then literally the last person to get off was the captain. Accountability does come with real risks, but we're talking about a business context here. The risk in a business context would be that you'd probably be the last one to get your capital back out. You'd be the last one to get paid for your time, the time that you put in, the capital you put into the company. These are at risk. But the point that he makes is that in a modern society, this downside risk is actually quite small. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. He writes, I'm most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high integrity effort. So at this point, we have talked about specific knowledge and we have talked about accountability, but even those things aren't enough. Like, for example, you could imagine a doctor who is employed by this big hospital and that doctor or surgeon is really, really good. They are taking risks under their own personal name and they have deep specific knowledge, but they are unlikely to get as rich as the person who owns the hospital. And that brings us to point number three from Naval's book. And point number three is equity. Naval writes, if you don't own a piece of a business, you don't have a path towards financial freedom. Why is owning equity in a business important to becoming rich? Well, it's ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you're not Going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You're not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation without ownership. Your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salary job, even one paying a lot per hour, like lawyer or doctor, you're still putting in the hours and every hour you get paid without ownership. When you're sleeping, you're not earning. When you're retired, you're not earning. When you're on vacation, you're not earning and you can't earn non linearly. If you look at even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it's because they open a business, they open a private practice. The private practice builds a brand and the brand attracts people, or they build some kind of medical device, a procedure or a process with intellectual property. Essentially you're working for somebody else and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability. The intellectual property and the brand, they're not going to pay you enough. They're going to pay you the bare minimum they have to to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it's still not going to be true wealth where you're retired, but still earning. If you look at someone like a management consultant or someone like a lawyer, or someone like a private equity partner, the way they get really rich is because they own equity in the business. It tends not to be from the salary that they're getting paid. And as he talks about, there's a couple of different routes here. So for example, you could work at a tech company that gives you amount of equity in the company in return for you working there. You know, there's a lot of people who join early stage startups, they're taking a big risk because most startups don't work. But if the startup does work and then sells for, I don't know, tens of hundreds of millions or billions or whatever the thing might be, then even as an early stage employee, you can get pretty rich in that process. Secondly, There is what MJ DeMarco calls the slow lane path to wealth, which is basically where you have a job and you spend less than you earn and then you put the remainder of that into something like the stock market. And so you could invest that in the S&P 500, you could invest in the top 500 companies in the US you could invest in just tech stocks or whatever. The problem with that approach is that if you want to make real wealth through that, you have to be putting in a Ton of money, like millions into the stock market to get enough passive income for it to be, you know, lead to meaningful wealth, for meaningful financial freedom. But what MJ Demark calls the fast lane path to wealth is by starting your own business because you have 100% or like a massive chunk of equity in your own business, rather than trying to buy 0.0000001% of Apple every year based on like the amount of money, spare money you saved up from your salary, for example. Example. But even equity ownership by itself has limits. Like if you imagine you starting a very small business, like the local restaurant or something, you are unlikely to get very rich off of starting just simply the local restaurant. And that is where principle number four comes in. And that is leverage. Now, this whole leverage stuff is something that Naval is very famous for. He writes that there are three broad classes of leverage. One form of leverage is labor. Are the humans working for you? It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You're one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. Secondly, money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It's more modern. It's the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It's probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century. But then the final form of leverage is brand new, the most democratic form. It is products with no marginal cost of replication. This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer. You don't need anyone's permission. This whole idea of leverage is being able to multiply your own efforts. This book, for example, is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people and that would have been that. So books, for example, are a form of media leverage, where you do the work once and then you could sell the thing potentially infinite times. Code software, for example, is a form of leverage where you do the work once to create the product and maybe a little bit of work in maintaining it. And then in theory, you could sell it an infinite number of times. Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new Forms of leverage is that they are permissionless. They don't require somebody else's permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, someone has to decide to follow you or be employed by you. For capital leverage, someone has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product. Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, youtubing, these kinds of things are permissionless. You don't need anyone's permission to do them. And that's why they are very egalitarian. They're great equalizers of leverage. Every great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime while he or she sleeps, after they've written the code and it's cranking away. So if you combine these things, if you've got specific knowledge, I. E. This combination of unique skills that are somewhat unique to you, that you have personal interest in, you combine that with accountability, like taking risks under your own personal name, putting your personal name to something, and being accountable for outputs or outcomes. You combine that with starting a business around the thing and having equity in that particular business, then you choose a vehicle. So rather than opening the local restaurant that has very little leverage around it, unless you, like, hire people to work in your restaurant, which is kind of annoying, you find a way to use media or content and code in particular to like, do the stuff that you know as your vehicle for the business. All of that sets you up very nicely to become wealthy, to become financially free. And then we have key principle number five, which is time. And there is a subsection in the book entitled Be patient. One thing I figured out later in life is generally, at least in the tech business in Silicon Valley, great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient. Every person I met at the beginning of my career 20 years ago, where I looked at them and said, wow, that guy or gal is super capable, so smart and dedicated. All of them, almost without exception, became extremely successful. You just had to give them a long enough timescale. It never happens in the timescale you want or they want, but it does happen. It takes time. Even once you have all of these pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. If you're counting, you'll run out of patience before success actually arrives. Oh, that's good. If you're counting, you'll run out of patience before success actually arrives. Again, this speaks to this idea around following your curiosity. If you're doing something that genuinely feels like play to you, you won't Be counting the minutes down and like the hours down and the days and the years waiting, waiting to become successful, waiting to become rich. You'd be doing the thing anyway. And weirdly, it's the people who are not seeking the money who tend to get the money. Everybody wants to be rich immediately, but the world is an efficient place. Immediate doesn't work. You do have to put in the time, you do have to put in the hours. And so I think you have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with the accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set. You have to be the best in the world at what you do. Oh, this is good stuff. This is good stuff. You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, Keep doing it and keep doing it. Don't keep track and don't keep count because if you do, you will run out of time. Man, that's good stuff. Now you know, I was in two minds about whether or not to make this video because I like to make videos that are a bit more actionable, that give you more of like a step by, you know, follow the step by step process. Here's how you build a YouTube channel from the ground, et cetera, et cetera. But this book doesn't really give you a step by step process. Instead it gives you more like the philosophical, like, like the way of thinking about it. And what I was really worried about before making this video is that, oh, is there really any value in this video? Will people just think like, oh, they're not going to read the book because it's not, it's not step by step or it's just, it's too high level. And I thought, you know what, I benefited enormously from this book by thinking in these different ways. By thinking like, okay, specific knowledge. What are the, what are the different factors that I'm personally interested in where I can find the intersection of those Accountability. Okay, cool. I need to take risks under my own, under my own personal name and really I need to decorrelate my own time from the value that I'm trying to add to the world. I need to be owning pieces of businesses, preferably my own business. I need to have leverage. And so media or content, which, which is the thing that I do and code, which is the thing that we're now doing with software like VoicePal and Progress Pal and Super Focus. Me and my team are building various different apps that is a form of code based leverage. And then the time thing is like, oh, I just need to do this over a long enough time horizon. Like following this advice and thinking in these terms for myself has had an enormous impact on my own life. And I think this is a really good framework. Like, if you're genuinely interested in becoming financially free and becoming wealthy, you really can't expect to get there by watching a YouTube video that gives you a step by step roadmap. Because like I said, if there was a step by step roadmap, other people would already be following it and it would be priced into the system and it wouldn't work anymore. But what I really love about this book is that we've barely scratched the surface. There's a load of interesting stuff in here about happiness and about health and about like, what's even the point of money anyway? But like, we've literally just focused on the first, I don't know, 50, 50, 60, 70 pages that specifically talk about how to get wealthy. I really would recommend the book. There's a lot of really good wisdom in here, but I'm hoping that if you've gotten to this point in the video, you can see that this was a little bit of a high level thing. But I'm hoping you found it useful anyway. And like I said, you should definitely check out the book if you are looking for more specific advice on how to become financially free. This video over here is a conversation I had with a friend recently who is a corporate lawyer who wants to become financially free by making passive income. And this is a recounting of the conversation that we had that goes into a little bit more practicalities around how to actually do this stuff. So thank you so much for watching and I will see you hopefully in the next video.","160-153164: The Almanac of Naval Ravikant says to find and build specific knowledge

This video analyzes key concepts from ""The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,"" focusing on achieving financial freedom through five components: **specific knowledge** (unique skills from innate curiosity), **accountability** (risking personal reputation), **equity** (owning business assets), **leverage** (amplifying output via labor, capital, or media/code), and **time** (patience for compounding results). The host connects these ideas to personal examples and discusses Riverside (a sponsor) as a tool for media-based leverage.

### Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-02:33] The Almanac of Naval Ravikant says to find and build specific knowledge**  
Naval defines specific knowledge as skills rooted in innate curiosity, passion, and unique talent—not formal training. It often feels like ""play"" to the individual but appears as work to others. Examples include the host’s childhood interests in reading, teaching, and building, which evolved into his content-creation career. Naval emphasizes pursuing genuine interests over market trends, as unique combinations (e.g., Joe Rogan’s comedy + martial arts + podcasting) create irreplaceable value.  

**[02:33-03:58] Riverside is an online studio for video and podcasting**  
The host praises Riverside for enabling high-quality, AI-assisted content creation (4K recording, auto-editing, captions). He ties this to ""media leverage,"" a key wealth-building tool. A promotion offers free Riverside Pro access to the first 1,000 users, framing it as a practical step for creators to scale their influence.  

**[03:58-07:03] You can think about internal versus external motivation when building specific knowledge**  
Internal motivation (e.g., tinkering with computers for fun) vs. external (e.g., chasing AI trends for profit) determines long-term success. Naval advises focusing on process over outcomes and combining unusual interests (e.g., Naval’s investing + philosophy). Self-reflection prompts include: ""What feels like play to you but work to others?"" and ""What unique skill intersections do you have?""  

**[07:03-07:45] Having specific knowledge alone isn't enough if you want to build wealth**  
Specific knowledge must be paired with accountability and leverage. Examples include experts lacking wealth due to no equity (e.g., salaried doctors vs. hospital owners) or no leverage. The host introduces accountability as the next critical component.  

**[07:45-09:36] Naval says embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name**  
Accountability involves publicly staking your reputation (e.g., Warren Buffett’s brand attracting businesses). Naval contrasts employees (paid for inputs) with entrepreneurs (rewarded for outcomes). Doctors or consultants maximize earnings by personal branding (e.g., ""best surgeon in NYC""), not just institutional affiliation.  

**[09:36-12:48] Naval talks about being accountable for your outputs rather than your inputs**  
Three accountability levels: **inputs** (hourly wages), **outputs** (project fees), and **outcomes** (profit-sharing). Freelancers charging per article (outputs) earn more than hourly workers, but true wealth comes from outcome ownership (e.g., equity). Naval argues modern risks (e.g., bankruptcy) are manageable, making accountability safer than perceived.  

**[12:48-15:29] If you don't own a business, Naval says, you lack financial freedom**  
Ownership (equity) is critical: salaried professionals (even high earners) trade time for money, while business owners earn passively. Examples include early startup employees gaining equity windfalls or MJ DeMarco’s ""fast lane"" entrepreneurship. Small businesses (e.g., restaurants) lack scalability without leverage.  

**[15:29-19:18] Naval writes that there are three broad classes of leverage**  
1. **Labor** (hard to manage, outdated).  
2. **Capital** (effective but requires permission).  
3. **Permissionless leverage** (media, code, AI—scale infinitely). The host highlights content creation (books, videos) and software as modern tools. Naval prioritizes code/media for democratized access, enabling ""armies of robots"" to work while you sleep.  

**[19:18-21:20] This video is based on a conversation I had recently about becoming financially free**  
The host reflects on Naval’s philosophy: wealth requires patience and nonlinear effort. He admits the advice is abstract but impactful, sharing how it shaped his apps (VoicePal) and content. Anecdotes stress aligning work with curiosity to avoid burnout. The video concludes by recommending Naval’s book and linking to a related discussion on passive income.

### Key Points:  
- **Specific knowledge** stems from innate curiosity, not formal training, and thrives at the intersection of unique skills.  
- **Accountability** (risking your name) and **equity** (ownership) are prerequisites for capturing wealth.  
- **Permissionless leverage** (media/code) scales impact infinitely, unlike labor or capital.  
- **Time** and patience are essential—success compounds nonlinearly for those who persist.

Insight/Outlook: True financial freedom emerges from combining unique skills, ownership, and scalable leverage over decades, not short-term hustle."
audio_11.mp3,"Throughout your life, you've been led to believe that money is the only type of wealth. In reality, your wealthy life may involve money, but it will be defined by everything else. That is the core message behind this excellent book, the Five Types of Wealth by Sahil Bloom, which is a transformative guide to designing your dream life. It is a mammoth of a book. I have made lots and lots of highlights, taken lots of notes. I've taken a lot of stuff from this book that I'm applying to my own life. And that's why we are discussing this book in this episode of Book Club, the ongoing series where for the last five years I've been distilling and discussing summaries and highlights from some of my favorite books or what. I spoke to hundreds of much, much older people, like 80, 90 year old people, and ask them about the things that they would tell to their younger self. What did they really think about? What were the things that were meaningful and impactful to them? And all of them across the board say the same things. They say time, they say purpose, they say people, and they say health. Very few of them talk about money. And yet, when you go back and you see how people are actually living during their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, it's all focused on that one thing. So the five types of wealth are time wealth, social wealth, mental wealth, physical wealth, and finally financial wealth. And so in this video, for each of these different types of wealth, we're going to be talking about what it means to have that kind of wealth. And secondly, I'm going to share one or two key actionable principles from the book. You can see it's an enormous book. I've taken loads and loads and loads of stuff away from it. But I'm just going to share one or two actionable points. If you want to get the rest of it, you should totally read the book. It's very good. But let's just dive into it. The first type of wealth, time wealth. All right, so this is the Memento Mori calendar. Memento Mori is Latin for remember you will die. And each of the boxes on this calendar represents one week of your life. Now, there are 80 rows of 52 weeks here. So this is the average 80 year old life and I am currently 30 and a half years old. And so this is what my momentum Mori calendar looks like. If you're in your 20s, this is roughly what your calendar might look like. If you're in your 30s, it looks something like this. If you're in your 40s, it looks something like this. And if you're in the roughly 5% of people who watch this channel who are in their 50s or above, then this is what your calendar might look like. And this sort of calendar is supposed to be a visual reminder of the fact that firstly, life is short, secondly, time always moves forward. And thirdly, that therefore we should probably be a little bit more intentional about how we spend our time. Time wealth is fundamentally the idea that your time is your most precious asset. This is something that people fail to recognize until it's too late. And the funny thing about time is you never think about it until the very end when it is the only thing that you think about. This brings a paradox to the surface, one I call the paradox of time. You are subconsciously aware of the immense value of your time, but you regularly and consciously take actions disregard that value. In his on the shortness of Life, Seneca wrote, we are not given a short life, but we make it short. And we are not ill supplied but wasteful of it. You know how important your time is, yet you ignore its passage and engage in low value activities that pull you away from the things that really matter. Now in the book, Sahil talks about three pillars of developing time wealth. The first pillar is awareness, where you have awareness of firstly the idea that time is very short and is always running out. And secondly where you have awareness over how you're actually spending your time. Once you have that awareness, the next step is attention, which is your ability to direct your attention and focus to things that really matter and ignore everything else that doesn't. And then the third and final pillar is control, where you genuinely have control over how you spend your time. And when it comes to time wealth, a lot of us fixate on this idea of control and we start saying things like well, I can't control how I spend my time because I have a job or because I have a family or because this, that and the other. But the point that Sahil makes in the book, which I very much agree with, is that control is the thing third pillar. We can all have more awareness of how we're spending our time and the finite nature of it. And we can all definitely improve our ability to pay attention to the things that matter. Like I suspect for most of us if we look at our screen time on our phones, we're not really giving attention to the stuff that genuinely matters to us. If we genuinely had awareness that we were going to die and that time is our most valuable non renewable resource, we probably wouldn't be spending our attention on the things that we're currently up. And once you've got this awareness and you can direct your focus and attention in a sensible way, at that point you can work towards genuinely getting control of your own time. For each of these five different types of wealth, there are five questions each that help you figure out what is your own level of time wealth, social wealth, physical wealth, mental wealth, and financial wealth. So I'm going to read out the five questions for time wealth. And the idea is that for each of these questions you're giving yourself a score from 0 to 4. So 0 is if you strongly disagree, 4 is if you strongly agree. So these are the five time wealth questions and it might be worth pausing the video in a second and answering these questions for yourself if you would like. Question number one. I have a deep awareness of the finite, impermanent nature of my time and its importance as my most precious asset. I have a clear understanding of the two to three most important priorities in my personal and professional lives. Three, I'm able to consistently direct attention and focus to the important priorities I have identified. Four, I rarely feel too busy or scattered to spend time on the most important priorities. And five, I am in control of my calendar and priorities. So feel free to pause the video at this point and answer these five questions for yourself. And if you feel like doing a little bit of mental maths, you can even add up your score out of 20. Now the point of doing a quiz like this is not to make you feel bad or anything like that. It's literally to identify where you are and then you can set a goal for okay, in the next 12 months, I would like to increase my time wealth score or whatever score it might be to whatever points. Something Sahel recommends is that you also define an anti goal which is on my way to increasing my time wealth score. I want to avoid doing the following. And then you figure out high leverage systems that you can implement into your life. And he's got like dozens in the book. But the idea is that you pick one, two or three of them, you apply them to your life and those will help you increase your time wealth score. But there's one that I've started applying to my own calendar right now, which is the appreciation of the four types of professional time. So when it comes to our professional lives, Sahil argues that there are four types of time. Type one is management and management. Time is what most of us spend the majority of our professional time in. That's things like meetings and calls and presentations and processing emails and like team and people management. Then you've got type two which is creation time. And creation time is the second most common type of professional time. It's what most of us scramble to get done in the gaps between management time blocks and typical activities of creation time include writing, coding, building and preparing. Creation is where new progress is found. Thriving organizations have a focus on creation time and thriving individuals as well and ensure that management time doesn't infringe on it. Then we have type 3 which is consumption time. Consumption time is one of the two forgotten types of professional time. It's where new ideas for creation and growth are planted. Typical activities include reading, listening and studying. And then we have type 4 time which is ideation time. This is where new ideas for creation and growth are cultivated and grown. And typical activities include brainstorming, journaling, walking or self reflecting. Sahil writes that most of us have zero time for stillness and thought in our day to day professional lives. So we make linear progress and miss out on the asymmetric opportunities that require creative non linear thinking. I completely agree. The idea is that you go through your calendar and you color code the blocks of time in each of these four different types of time and then from that baseline you can work towards a more optimized balance. So for example, tip number one here is to batch management time. Like ideally you want management time to be all in one go rather than scattered throughout the place as it is for most of our professional lives. Secondly, you want to increase creation time. Like try and actively make up blocks for creation time. First thing in the morning is often a good time to do that. And thirdly, and the thing that I'm personally working on is to create space for consumption and ideation. Now speaking of time wealth, one of my favorite new tools that I'm experimenting a lot with for scheduling my time intentionally is Reclaim AI who are very kindly sponsoring this video. Reclaim AI is an AI powered calendar. So instead of manually time blocking every single week on the calendar, Reclaim has a bunch of cool features that automatically help build out your ideal week without spending more time in Google Calendar. It also automatically reschedules stuff if you have any calendar conflicts, which means you can stay flexible while hopefully making sure you never actually drop the ball. Now there are three features in particular that I've been playing a lot with recently. Firstly is the habits feature. So these are daily non negotiables that I want reclaimed to put in my calendar each day. They've also got a really interesting tasks feature. So essentially it's like a to do list. But you can define tasks in different priorities and then based on the priority and the deadline and how much time the task will take, it will automatically time block the task for you. And then if you manage to do the task, it goes off the list. But if you don't manage to do the task in that time, it will block it to another time based on like the AI algorithmy thing. And then the other nice thing is that Reclaim can also add automatic flexible buffer times into your schedule in between stuff. So if for example, I have a personal trainer session after a meeting, then it will automatically know that and it will figure out how much buffer time to put in my Calendar. Reclaim also has a time tracking feature that shows you how you're spending your time. And personally, me and my team are big advocates for time tracking so that you can really have that awareness of, oh crap, you know, this is where I'm spending my time and this is where I want to be spending my time. So if you're looking for a way to level up your time management game without spending more time fiddling around Google Calendar, then I would recommend checking out Reclaim. And very excitingly, you can get an extended 30 day trial of all the premium features when you sign up to the free plan with my link Reclaim AI Ali Abdaal. That'll be linked down below as well. It's a cool tool. I'd recommend trying it out and seeing if it fits within your workflow. So thank you so much Reclaim, for sponsoring this video. And let's get back to it. The second type of wealth, Social wealth. All right, so here's some really interesting looking graphs from the American Time Use Survey, which is something that the U.S. bureau of labor and Statistics has apparently been putting together since 2003. And so these graphs show on average, how people spend their time as they age. This is the graph of time spent with family. Time spent with your parents and siblings peaks in childhood and declines sharply after you reach age 20. As you leave home and get caught up in your own life, you often fail to recognize that the time you have remaining with your family is so very limited. Cherish these relationships while you can. This is the graph of time spent with your children. Time spent with your children peaks in the early years of their lives and declines sharply thereafter. There's a devastatingly short window during which you are your child's entire world. Don't blink and miss it. Time spent with your friends peaks when you're 18 and then declines sharply to a low baseline. In your youth, you spend A lot of time with a lot of friends as you enter adulthood, you spend a little bit of time with a few close friends. Embrace the breadth of friendships that comes with youth, and prioritize the depth of friendships that should come with age. Time spent with your partner trends up until death. The person you choose to confront life's ups and downs with will have the largest impact on your happiness and fulfillment. Choose wisely. Time spent with co workers is steady during the traditional prime working years from age 20 to age 60, and declines sharply thereafter. Work will pull you away from your family and loved ones throughout your life. If you have the luxury of choice, make sure you choose work and co workers that you find meaningful and important. Aim to have co workers who create energy in your life. And then finally, time spent alone steadily increases throughout your life. When you're young, you tend to view time alone as a sign of not fitting in. You come to fear time alone, to fear boredom. But you need to learn to cherish it. Find happiness and joy in the time you have to yourself. There will be more of it as you get older. So here are six key lessons for life. Family time is finite. Cherish it. Children time is precious. Be present. Friend time is limited. Prioritize the real friends. Partner time is meaningful. Never settle. Co worker time is significant. Find energy and alone time is abundant. Love yourself. Now, there is a cool exercise that he recommends in the book, which I'm actually in the process of doing, and that's called the Relationship map. So the idea is that step one, you list your core relationships in your life, and this will be in the range of 10 to 15, but maybe up to 25 core relationships, the core people you interact with. Then step two is you want to assess these core relationships. So for each of these core relationships, we are asking ourselves two questions. Firstly, is the relationship supportive, ambivalent or demeaning? And secondly, is the relationship interaction frequent or infrequent? So a supportive relationship is one where there is mutual understanding of care, love, respect and comfort. A demeaning relationship is characterized by the absence of those qualities and typically involves specific behavior that undermines one's self worth. And then an ambivalent relationship has elements of both supportive and demeaning relationships. At different times, it is inconsistent. And then step three is we want to map the core relationships on the relationship map in terms of how demeaning or supportive the relationship is and then how rare or frequent that interaction is. Now, once you've mapped these out, you'll find that there is a relationship green zone These are relationships that are supportive and that happen quite frequently. So you want to focus on cultivating those relationships. There is obviously a red zone where the relationship is very demeaning, but also you have to encounter it quite frequently. And then the goal would be to either try and make it less demeaning or to try and reduce the frequency of those encounters. There is actually a danger zone. And that danger zone is actually the ambivalent relationships, the ones that are inconsistent. That's, you know, sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad, sometimes they're supportive, sometimes they're demeaning. And the danger zone is when we have those sorts of daily relationships. And actually those relationships, apparently, according to the research, cause more damage to our mental health than the fully demeaning relationships. Like, if we're not sure how someone is going to respond to us, that can actually be more painful, more damaging than if we know that they're demeaning all the time. And then you have the opportunity zone. This is the area that I'm personally focused on because I have a lot of supportive relationships, but where my contact with those people is rare or not as frequent as I would like. And so then it's about finding actionable ways to get more contact with those sorts of people. Again, in the book, there are a bunch of other systems and tools that you can use to cultivate social wealth. And these are the five questions that you can use to assess your social wealth score. And again, if you would like to do this, feel free to pause the video and have a think for yourself. Or you can go on wealthscorequiz.com I'll link it down below. That's a website that Sahil and his team have created where you can do the quiz and will give you personalized responses based on your answers. The third type of wealth, mental wealth. All right, so again, on screen, these are the five questions for your mental wealth score. So feel free to pause the video. Now if you would like to do these. And again, if you decide to do these, you can add up your score and that should give you a score out of 20. But the one I want to specifically discuss in this video, because otherwise this video would be like eight hours long, is question number five, which is, I have regular rituals that allow me to create space to think, think, reset, wrestle with questions and recharge. And this idea of creating space, this is one of the things that I've historically neglected with my whole, like, desire to be more productive and to be efficient. But I found that for me, the times where I have space, where I've got some free time to just journal or to just think or like I'm on a plane with no wifi. Those are the times where I come up with my best ideas. And those are the ideas that make asymmetrical gains in my business and my life, rather than just sort of continuing and plugging along as usual. And I want to talk about two strategies here. The first one is one that I'm actively incorporating into my life as we speak, which is the Think Day now the story here. And I actually wrote about this in my own book, Field of Productivity. The most famous example of this is Bill Gates, who used to take these Think weeks where he would spend a week basically going off the grid, going to a cabin in the woods. He would have a private chef prepare all his meals and he would be disconnected from the Internet and from devices and stuff for that week. And he would just use that time to read and learn and reflect. And he cites a lot of the gains and like good ideas that Microsoft did. He attributes them to taking those like one week off the grid kind of periods, those think weeks. Now that's a cool concept, but most of us don't have the time or the space to be able to take a whole week off with a private chef in a cabin in the woods. But one thing Asyl mentions in the book that I really like is the idea of a Think day rather than a Think week. If you're like me, you don't have an entire week to dedicate to thinking, but you can adapt something with a similar core vision. The Think Day was my adaptation. Pick one day each month to step back from all of your day to day professional demands. Seclude yourself mentally or physically. Put up an out of office response and shut off all your devices. The goal? Spend the entire day reading, learning, journaling and thinking. By doing this, you create the free time to zoom out, open your mind and think creatively about the bigger picture. And here are eight thinking prompts that Sahel has found particularly useful. 1. If I repeated my current typical day for 100 days, would my life be better or worse? 2. If people observed my actions for a week, what would they say my priorities are? 3. If I were the main character in a movie of my life, what would the audience be screaming at me to do right now? 4. Am I hunting antelopes? Big important problems or field mice? Small urgent problems problems? 5. How can I do less but better? 6. What are my strongest beliefs? What would it take for me to change my mind on them? 7, what are a few things I know now that I wish I'd known five years ago? And eight, what actions did I engage in five years ago that I cringe at today? What actions am I engaged in today that I might cringe at in five years now? As you guys might know, I absolutely love collecting journaling prompts. It is one of my favorite things to do. And so linked down below is my life changing journaling prompt prompts list. It's completely free, we keep it updated. It's got these prompts in it and also loads of others. So if you are taking a think a day, if you are taking some time to journal, then hopefully you can get some value out of these powerful questions that can help change the way that you think about stuff. It's completely free. Link down below. And speaking of journaling, if you haven't yet tried journaling, Sahil has this one, one, one method that is a good starting point to get started with journaling. I was creating this very high bar for what journaling was and I was allowing optimal to get in the way of beneficial. So what I've done in response is I created something that I call the 1-1111-method which is at the end of every day, you sit down and you write one win from the day. Something you felt good about, one point of tension or anxiety, something that is on your head that feels like a burden that you can put down onto the paper and one point of gratitude, something that you felt grateful for. Small or big. During the course of the day, it takes three to five minutes max and you immediately get this feeling and sensation of calm and positivity to end your day. The fourth type of wealth, Physical wealth. Now these are the five questions for physical wealth. Again, feel free to pause the video right now and to do this for yourself. When I took the wealth score quiz myself, this was my lowest score. I actually did this a couple of months ago when Sahil came to Hong Kong to record this podcast interview that we did. And since then my score has actually substantially increased because doing the quiz made me realize, oh crap, my physical wealth score is by far the lowest score. Let me actually do stuff about it. And so since then, gone back to the gym. I've started running every day. I've got my first squash lesson today. I had a Muay Thai lesson yesterday. Basically, I'm just like, you know, making my physical health a priority. Now again, in the book, there's a bunch of different strategies that you can use to increase your Physical wealth score. But there's one concept that I found really useful, which is the idea of the dimmer switch. Your entire life exists on dimmer switches. All of these different areas, the five types of wealth, they all exist on a dimmer switch. And there's this tendency or this flawed belief that all of this stuff exists on and on, off. So you can pursue financial wealth, but you have to turn off your family, you have to turn off relationships, your health, all of these other areas. And that's fundamentally incorrect. So this dimmer switch mentality kind of made me realize that, that actually, you know what, going to the gym for 15 minutes is better than not going at all. And like cooking one meal at home is better than ordering takeaway for all three meals. Like, I think when it comes to my physical wealth in particular, I have been letting perfect be the enemy of good. You can identify those things, the high leverage actions that you can take that don't take a lot of time but allow you to continue compounding on those things that aren't your primary focus. You can do the five minute thing that continues to build your relationships or continues to push your health in the right direction. Because with all of these areas, anything above zero compounds positively. This is actually a mantra that I've been telling myself quite a lot since this conversation with Sahil. Anything above zero compounds positively. That means on a day where I'm in meetings all day or I'm doing a lot of work stuff and I haven't done anything for my physical health, I keep in mind that anything above zero compounds positively, but zero compounds negatively. Like physical wealth is one of those things that if you leave to its own devices and if nothing happens, it will actually deteriorate over time. So I keep that in mind and think, okay, cool. What is one small action I can take? Can I just go for a 10 minute run? Can I do a 15 minute gym session? Can I just do anything in this department, anything above zero that would help compound and like fight the entropy that happens especially when you get to your 30s and above as it relates to physical health. And that brings us on to the fifth type of wealth, financial wealth. And these are the five questions as part of the wealth Score quiz for financial wealth. Again, feel free to pause the video and try these out for yourself. But I want to focus on the first question here. And you know, the big question here is, what is your definition of enough? Now, Sahil opens this with in a short poem about his late friend Joseph Heller, a famous American author best known for his work of satirical genius, Catch 22. Kurt Vonnegut shared an anecdote that offers a powerful piece of Heller's wisdom. As the two enjoyed a party at the home of a billionaire, Vonnegut asked Heller, joe, how does it make you feel to know that our host only yesterday may have made more money than your novel Catch 22 has earned in its entire history? Heller replied, I've got something he can never have, the knowledge that I've got enough. I've personally been grappling with this question, like a lot of us do, of what is enough ever since I achieved my goal of financial freedom, financial independence. I was able to quit the day job, et cetera, et cetera, be able to do what I love. Now it's a case of like genuinely, what does enough actually look like? And there is a fun story that Sahil writes about in the book. You might be familiar with the story. It is the parable of the Mexican fisherman. I am very familiar with the story, but I'm going to reread it out anyway because I think this is an important lesson worth Worth revisiting A wealthy investment banker goes on vacation to a tropical fishing village. As he walks along the docks one afternoon, he comes upon a small run down fishing boat with several large fish on its deck. How long did it take you to catch those fish? He asks. The fisherman looks up from his work and smiles at his new visitor. Only a little while. The investment banker is taken aback by the response. He likes the fisherman and wants to help. Why don't you fish for longer so you can catch more fish? The fisherman shrugs and explains to his new friend that he has all he needs needs. Each day I sleep late, fish a little, and spend some time with my children and beautiful wife. In the evening I go into town, drink wine, play the guitar and sing and laugh with my friends. The investment banker is puzzled. He wants to help his new friend, who in his opinion is clearly confused. So he lays out a plan for the fishermen. First, you spend more time fishing so you can catch and sell more fish. You use the proceeds to buy a bigger boat which allows you to catch and sell even more fish. Then you buy a fleet of boats. You hire a team, vertically integrate as the CEO of a large growing enterprise. You could move to the big city. You would take your company public and make millions. The fisherman looks confused but smiles. And then what? He asks. The investment banker laughs at the silly question. Well then you could retire to a quiet town. You could sleep late, fish a little, and spend some time with Your children and beautiful wife. And in the evenings you could go into town, drink wine, play the guitar and sing and laugh with your friends. Ah, I love this story. Absolutely love this story. It's great. This is Sahil's interpretation. The popular interpretation of this parable is that the investment banker is wrong and the fisherman is right. My own interpretation is that this story isn't about the fisherman being right and the banker being wrong. It's about identifying what success and purpose look like to you and building a life that meets that definition. It's about defining your enough life and then working to embrace it. Maybe both the fisherman and the banker are happy with their choices and priorities. I'll let them decide. The same goes for you. Now, there is apparently a word in Swedish called lagom which means just the right amount. And this thing around defining what our enough life is, defining what our lagom life actually looks like, helps us overcome something called the Arrival Fallacy. The arrival fallacy is the name for that exact phenomenon that we think that we are going to feel like we've arrived when we get to whatever that thing is. And ultimately what actually happens is you get there and your sights immediately reset to whatever the next thing is. You get this kind of momentary feeling of this like dopamine induced euphoria and then you just reset to this feeling of, of. Is that it? Is this all it is? What's the next thing? It's Never enough. There's also a wonderful book by a chap called Andrew Wilkinson who used to be a barista and is now a billionaire. And the title of that book is Never Enough From Barista to Billionaire, which also talks about this concept that like, for people who are trying to build financial wealth, it's like it's so hard to overcome the temptation to just keep on seeking more and more and more. This is something that I'm still trying to grapple with, trying to figure out how much do I want to grow the business business, how much do I want to prioritize my life? How much do I, you know, how do I balance all the things knowing that, you know, I could make more millions by focusing on the business, but I already have enough. But let's, you know, there's this always the trade off between. I seem to sort of flip flop between these, these two sides of the pendulum where at certain moments in time I'm like, yep, I've got enough, life's good. And other moments of time I'm like, no, but I want more. I want to, you know, Whatever. Probably the single most powerful exercise anyone can do here is to write the journaling prompt at the top of your page, what does my enough life look like? And then sit down and actually create a clear visual in your mind of what you have, where you are, who you're with, what you're doing, how you feel, what you're working on, what you're spending time on. Like, really create a visual of that life. If you were to close your eyes and truly just imagine that you're waking up in the morning and you feel that you have enough. For me, the thing that I get to, after doing this, this exercise, is that I'm already living my enough life. And yes, it's fine to try and grow the business for the sake of the fun, the enjoyment of playing the video game. Sometimes I try and connect that to the impact that, you know, we can have by, I don't know, making more videos, writing more books, making more software. But if I'm being honest, like, for the most part, the reason I continue to work is because I find it quite fun and fulfilling. And I just have to try and remind myself that, like, if it's a choice between making more money and doing what I love, I should pick doing what I love rather than trying to make more money. More money. Anyway, if you enjoyed this video and you got to this point, you would definitely love reading the book. You should definitely check it out. And if you're interested in more on the whole financial wealth front, I have a video here which is my honest advice to someone who wants financial freedom, where I talk a friend through his struggles with, like, how to become financially free. So thank you so much for watching. Have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.","160-81450: The Five Types of Wealth is a transformative guide to designing your dream life

### Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:21] The Five Types of Wealth is a transformative guide to designing your dream life**  
The video introduces Sahil Bloom’s book, challenging the conventional focus on financial wealth by outlining five types: time, social, mental, physical, and financial. The host shares anecdotes of elderly individuals prioritizing time, purpose, relationships, and health over money, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of each wealth type.

**[01:22-04:03] Time wealth is the idea that your time is your most precious asset**  
Time wealth is framed as life’s most valuable resource, illustrated by a ""Memento Mori"" calendar visualizing an 80-year lifespan. Seneca’s philosophy on time waste is cited, alongside Bloom’s three pillars of time wealth: *awareness* (of time’s finiteness), *attention* (focusing on priorities), and *control* (intentional scheduling). The host stresses overcoming excuses to prioritize meaningful activities.

**[04:04-05:38] Five time wealth questions help you assess your level of time wealth**  
Five self-assessment questions evaluate time management: awareness of time’s value, clarity on priorities, focus, avoidance of busyness, and calendar control. Scoring 0–20 identifies gaps, with anti-goals and systems (e.g., time-blocking) suggested for improvement. The host encourages viewers to pause and self-reflect.

**[05:39-07:15] Sahil argues that there are four types of professional time**  
Professional time is categorized into: *management* (meetings/emails), *creation* (productive work), *consumption* (learning), and *ideation* (creative thinking). Tips include batching management tasks, prioritizing creation time, and scheduling consumption/ideation blocks. The host admits struggling with ideation time but commits to improvement.

**[07:16-08:54] Reclaim AI is an AI powered calendar that automatically time blocks**  
Reclaim AI, a sponsor, automates calendar management by syncing tasks, habits, and buffers. Features include habit tracking, priority-based task scheduling, and time-use analytics. The host praises its flexibility and promotes a 30-day trial, linking it to time-wealth principles.

**[08:55-11:01] American Time Use Survey shows how people spend their time as they age**  
Data reveals declining family/friend time with age, urging viewers to cherish relationships early. Partner time grows lifelong, while alone time increases. Key lessons: prioritize family, be present with children, nurture friendships, choose partners wisely, and embrace solitude.

**[11:02-12:50] Step one is to identify your core relationships in your life**  
A ""Relationship Map"" exercise identifies 10–25 core relationships, assessing their supportiveness and interaction frequency. Categories include *green zone* (supportive/frequent), *red zone* (demeaning/frequent), and *opportunity zone* (supportive/rare). The host focuses on strengthening opportunity-zone connections.

**[12:51-13:57] These are the five questions you can use to assess your social wealth score**  
Social wealth questions evaluate relationship quality, conflict resolution, and community engagement. The host recommends Bloom’s online quiz (wealthscorequiz.com) for personalized feedback and actionable steps.

**[13:58-16:56] Sahel recommends the Think Day as a great way to boost productivity**  
Mental wealth is tied to reflection rituals like monthly ""Think Days""—offline periods for reading, journaling, and brainstorming. Eight prompts (e.g., ""What would an audience scream at me to change?"") aid creative thinking. The host shares a free journaling prompts list and Bloom’s ""1-1-1 method"" (one win, one tension, one gratitude daily).

**[16:57-19:06] The fourth type of wealth, Physical wealth, has the lowest average score**  
Physical wealth questions address exercise, nutrition, and sleep. The host admits scoring poorly but improved via gym routines and the ""dimmer switch"" mindset—prioritizing small, consistent actions (e.g., 10-minute runs) over perfection. ""Anything above zero compounds positively"" becomes a mantra to counter entropy.

**[19:07-23:19] Andrew Wilkinson: What is your definition of enough in financial wealth**  
Financial wealth centers on defining ""enough,"" illustrated by Joseph Heller’s contentment parable and the ""Mexican fisherman"" story. The host reflects on post-financial freedom struggles, advocating journaling to visualize an ""enough life"" and avoid the ""arrival fallacy"" (perpetual dissatisfaction).

**[23:20-24:35] Use this exercise to help you visualize your enough life**  
The video concludes with a journaling exercise to concretize one’s ""enough life,"" balancing financial goals with purpose. The host acknowledges his own pendulum swings between ambition and contentment, urging viewers to prioritize fulfillment over endless accumulation.

audio_12.mp3,"Increasingly, a lot of us seem to have this feeling that we are falling behind in life. There is this feeling that other people are already ahead of us. Like they figured out what to do with their lives. They've got the perfect career, they've started their business, they've gotten married, they've started a family. And I am still not hitting those little milestones that I'd set for myself. Now, this feeling of feeling behind is often the result of something called mimetic desire, which is what Luke Burgess talks about in this book, Wanting the Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life. And so we're going to be breaking down some of the insights from this book in this episode of Book Club, the ongoing series where for the last five years I have been distilling and discussing highlights and summaries from some of my favorite books. Part 1 why we feel behind in Life Right so broadly, this feeling of feeling behind comes from let's say you are here at point A and you want to be at point B. And point A could be anything. This could be like you're on a five figure salary and you want to be on a six figure salary or you're working a day job that you hate and you want to have your own business, or you're not yet married with kids and you want to be married with kids. Or like whatever. The thing is, like you are at point A and you want to be at point B. Now that in itself does not result in the feeling of being behind that actually could just form the basis for setting a goal. But specifically the feeling of feeling behind comes from the feeling of like I'm at point A, I want to be at point B, but actually I should already be at point B and I am not already at point B. Therefore I feel behind. I feel bad, I feel uncomfortable, I feel like I'm a loser, I feel like I'm a failure because I am not already where I would like to be now. A lot of the videos on this YouTube channel are about like, okay, how do you get yourself from A to B? How do you set a goal? How do you break it down? How do you be productive? How do you be efficient? Blah blah blah. But this video is going to be a little bit different because the point of this book is not about how do we get more efficient efficiently from A to B. It's really about asking why do we want B in the first place? And the whole shtick in this book, the thing that Luke Burgess is arguing is that you want that thing that you want quite possibly because of mimetic desire. And so in this video we're going to be breaking down exactly what mimetic desire is and where it comes from. And then we're going to go over a bunch of actionable strategies from the book that I found really helpful that hopefully you will find helpful as well in terms of how to mitigate the effect that mimetic desires have on our life and as a result, hopefully start feeling a little bit less behind. Part 2 what is mimetic desire and where does it come from? And here is a lovely story from the book that illustrates this My friend tells me about a promotion he's about to get. He'll receive a $20,000 boost in salary and have a new title, Managing Director of something or other. That sounds important. It comes with more vacation time too. As I smile and tell him how exciting that is, I feel some anxiety. Shouldn't I be making an extra $20,000 too? Will my friend and I still be able to plan vacations together if he gets twice as much paid time off as I do? And also, what the hell, we graduated from the same university and I worked twice as hard as he did in school after Am I falling behind? Did I choose the right path in life even though I used to say I could never be in his line of work? Now I'm second guessing myself. My friend has become a model of desire to me. We will never speak of it, but an inner force has been activated in me that if left unchecked, will cause conflict. I'll start to make decisions based on what he wants. If he moves to a certain neighborhood, I'll start evaluating where I live accordingly. If he reaches Delta Sky Miles Platinum status, I won't be satisfied with gold. This is the theory of mimetic desire that was first talked about by French philosopher Rene Gir. And the whole book basically is like an exploration of Girard's theories on mimetic desire. So where does this mimetic desire come from? And in the book, Luke talks about it being from two distinct worlds and he labels these two worlds Celebristan and Freshmanistan. Oh, by the way, if you didn't know Stan as the suffix in a lot of different countries like Pakistan and Kazakhstan and Afghanistan means place of or home of or land of. So Celebristan is the land of the celebrities, and Freshmanistan is the land of the people who are more like us. And the idea here is that we model the desires of these two different groups of people. We model the desires of Celebrities and influencers and like movie stars and stuff. We've never actually met these people, but we still look up to them for inspiration. Inspiration on what to do, but also inspiration on what to want. And so that's the stuff that a lot of us would be already familiar with. But then you've got Freshmanistan, which is the people who are like you, the people that you went to school with, your neighbors, your parents, your family members, your cousins. We form models of mimetic desire based on what these people around us want. And generally it's this category that causes us to feel behind. Like, you probably don't feel that behind because you're not as rich as Kim Kardashian. I suspect Kim Kardashian's not someone that you're looking to as a model of, like, oh, I should be here. But you might be feeling behind in life because your neighbor or your friend or your cousin or that person you went to university with is making more money than you are, or has a fancier business or seems to be more fulfilled or seems to have a more fulfilling marriage or whatever based on their social media feeds or whatever the thing might be. And in a way, we are directly competing against the second group of people when they are doing things and we feel like I should be there already and I'm not. Like, everyone around me seemingly is getting that promotion at work that is a profound model for mimetic desire and contributes to us feeling bad that we are behind. And by the way, if you are enjoying this video, then you might like to check out Brilliant. Brilliant, who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard, Brilliant is a wonderful learning platform which I've been using for the last five years and I absolutely love it. Now, one of my gripes with the education system is that in general, we are taught to passively consume stuff. But there's actually a bunch of research studies that show that this is a very ineffective way to learn. And what's much more effective is to learn by doing. That is where Brilliant comes in. They've got thousands of interactive lessons in maths and science and programming, data analysis and AI. And the interactive nature of these lessons means that you're doing rather than just consuming, which has been proven to be six times more effective than just watching lecture videos. They've got a first principles approach to learning which helps you build understanding from the ground up in all these various different subjects. And it's crafted by an award winning team of teachers, researchers and professionals from cool places like Stanford, mit, Caltech Microsoft, Google, and many more. Now one thing that I've been personally loving is their courses on AI. They have a series of courses on large language models and how they work. And even though I feel like I have a solid grasp of how to actually use the AI tools, it was super helpful to get the zoomed out perspective from experts in the field about how they actually work behind the scenes. And that's been really helpful in helping me understand what is actually going on when I prompt a large language model. Brilliant also helps you build a powerful daily learning habit. And as we know, learning new stuff a little bit every day is one of the most important things we can do for our personal and professional growth, which is the exact opposite of mindless scrolling on social media. So to try Brilliant for free, head over to brilliant.org Ali Abdaal or you can check out the link in the video description and that will also give you 20% off the annual premium subscription. So thank you so much Brilliant, for sponsoring this video. Now I'm going to put a few questions on screen that I would love for you, if you would like to pause the video and consider your answers to these questions. Firstly, who are the people in your freshmanistan who influence what you want? Secondly, what goals or possessions have you started wanting because someone else close to you wanted that thing? And thirdly, what achievements or milestones contribute to you feeling behind if someone else gets there first? Feel free to pause the video now and have a little think about this. And by the way, these are just some of the various journaling prompts that I like collecting for myself. Over time, I've put them all into a journaling hub, which is a completely free list of all of my favorite journaling prompts that'll be linked down below if you want to check it out. And these questions aren't easy to answer, but they can reveal where our desires come from. And I've seen this so much in my own life as well. Back when I was in school, the mimetic desire was around sort of the people or around me, like my friends, all wanting to get into the same universities, like the fancy universities to study fancy subjects like medicine. Then when I actually got into med school, it became about the prizes and the accolades and the publications and the points on the cv, and I'd never before wanted these things. But I was now in an environment where other people seemed to want those things. And so I, without thinking about it, modeled their desires like, oh, that person's going after those publications. I should probably be going after Those publications as well. Even now, many years after I've left medicine, I can still fall into that feeling of feeling behind. Because now my team and I are building software. And so we're like comparing our software growth rates for a voice pal or productivity writing app against other AI apps in the industry and being like, oh, wait a minute, but that app is growing faster and that app's gotten funded by that fancy investor, and ours hasn't done that yet, leading to that feeling of feeling behind. And I never thought I would care about things like software growth rates, but I've now started to find myself caring about it because I'm now in a group where other people around me care about the thing. And therefore, subconsciously I have modeled their desires. I've started to want or desire things that are maybe not my own intrinsic interests. And so what Rene Girard talked about is that we have this natural instinct to model the desires of the people around us. And this isn't necessarily always a negative thing. Our mimetic desires can be positive if, for example, you are inspired by the goals of someone else, or if those desires help you form social connections or get healthier or whatever, which is generally good for your life. And it does save some amount of mental energy when you can just sort of model someone else's goal because you don't then have to figure it out entirely for yourself. But it can become very problematic when we start chasing things that aren't actually meaningful to us, and especially when we are chasing things that make us feel inadequate or that we're constantly behind because we're not yet at that level that we thought we should be based on what the people around us are getting at now. As Luke writes in the book, the obsession we have with goal setting is misguided, even counterproductive. Setting goals isn't bad. But when the focus is on how to set goals rather than how to choose them in the first place, goals can easily turn into instruments of self flagellation. And the important thing to recognize here is that the things that we want shape the goals that we aspire to, which completely changes our actions and our feelings. If, for example, I grew up in Palo Alto and I found myself chasing the desire to build a billion dollar company, that desire to build billion company is going to shape the goals that I set for myself. And the goals that I set for myself are going to shape literally my day to day actions and also my feelings. Because if I'm 30 and haven't got a billion dollar company yet, I will feel bad I will feel behind in that context, the goals that we choose to set, which form from the desires that we have, are so incredibly important. And so this idea that goal selection is in many ways more important than goal achievement. This is probably why I spend so much time journaling and really trying to get a sense of, like, what do I actually want and to what extent is what I want modeled with my own authentic desires versus just what other people around me want? This is a big part of the vision component of life os as my productivity course. More details down below if you want to check it out. But it's really the sense that if you change the destination that you're aiming towards, it drastically changes the journey that you're on. And our choice of goals is ultimately dictated by our desires. And so that brings us on to part three. How do we actually chase meaningful desires? Now, strategy number one that I took away from the book is to identify thick versus thin desires. So in the book, Luke talks about thick desires as being kind of like layers of rock, that these are solid and they are enduring, and they are deeply embedded in who you are. These are the sorts of desires that you've probably had for a long time, maybe even since childhood. These desire, they don't change easily. You've had them for a long time, and they probably give you a sense of deep fulfillment when you're pursuing them. And we can contrast that with thin desires. These are more like the surface layer desires that we find ourselves wanting primarily because someone else around us that we respect or who's like our neighbor in some capacity because that person wants that thing, so we find ourselves wanting that thing as well. The easy example I see for this in my own life is that I've always had a thick desire to be interested in teaching. I was, like, teaching when I was in school even. Even when I was like 7 years old, I'd be helping kids who were like, 6 with their homework and kids in my class and all that stuff. Then When I was 13, I started teaching at this, like, maths and English study center. And that was really fun. And then when I was 16, I started doing private tutoring. And then when I was in med school, I was helping younger medical students and I started a business all about teaching. And ultimately when I created this YouTube channel, like, the thing that brings me fulfillment from it is the fact that I can read a book and share my insights from it and just, you know, share it with people. And that's kind of teaching, and that's kind of fun, and so for me, the desire to teach in that sense is probably a thick desire because it's been with me for a very long time and it hasn't changed very much. But then there are all these other thin desires that get painted over the top. For example, I often go to the US to take part in these, like, entrepreneurship conferences and to give talks and to go to these masterminds. And when I go to these events, I often feel like the brokest person there because there's all these people around me who have way bigger businesses and are making way more money. And then I find myself having this desire to be like, oh, you know, I want to get our business to $10 million in revenue, and I want to do this and I want to do that. And my team knows that whenever I come back from the US and like, start making plans for the business, to basically ignore everything I say for a full 72 hours, because generally within about three days, that desire to have a bigger business and, like, make more money and have a bigger team, all of that kind of stuff, those desires generally fade because they are thin desires that were modeled off of these other people I was hanging out with, rather than a thick intrins desire. And so if you finding yourself feeling behind because you're chasing some kind of desire, it might be worth asking yourself a few little journaling prompts around. Has this desire been with me for a long time? Does pursuing this desire energize me or does it actually drain me? And here's one of my favorite ones. Would I still want this thing even if no one could ever know that I had achieved that thing? And if you want to do these exercises by speaking them rather than writing them, then with VoicePal, the app that my team and I are building, we've just released a new frameworks feature. And so we've got a few guided frameworks for helping you figure out thick versus thin desires. And so the app is going to be linked down below. You can try it out for free on iOS and Andro, and within the free trial, you can try out these journaling frameworks, and you can see if it helps you get any more clarity on what your own desires are. The other fun way to identify thick desires is based on what Luke calls stories of fulfillment. And so a story of fulfillment has three things. Firstly, you took some kind of action. Secondly, you believe you did that thing kind of well. And thirdly, that thing gave you a lasting sense of accomplishment. And so the question you can ask yourself is, what is a time in my life? When I took action, and it made me feel genuinely fulfilled. For me, the example that often comes to mind is that in my fifth year, I was one of the directors of the medical school pantomime. And this was like a huge amount of investment in terms of like hour spent and like hours commuting to and from like hospital placements to do rehearsals and things like that and organizing stuff. No one got paid for it. It was fully a charity thing. But we brought like 100 plus medical students together who were all insanely talented. And we created this production that was way bigger than ourselves. And I remember that that as being like one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done. And so it's like, huh, you know, I was contributing towards this thing, working with a group of really talented people. We were creating something bigger than us. That's interesting. It's interesting that I found that very fulfilling. What can I learn from that about what my own thick desires are and how can I incorporate that more into what I'm doing with my work, for example? And then we come to t tip number two, which is to identify your Michelin stars. Now, there is a powerful story in the book that Luke talks about, and it's kind of a contrast between these two Michelin starred chefs. So in 2003, there was a chef called Bernard Loiseau who was one of France's most celebrated chefs. And one of his restaurants had three Michelin stars, which is very prestigious in the world of food. But then this chef heard from the Michelin inspectors that he might be losing one of his Michelin stars because the inspectors didn't like the lack of inventiveness or the artistic direction of his restaurant. At the same time, this chef got downgraded from 19 out of 20 points to 17 out of 20 points in some other restaurant rating system in France. And he ended up taking his own life shortly thereafter. And it's interesting to contrast this with another chef that he talks about in the book, Marco Pierre white. At age 32, Marco was the youngest chef to ever get three Michelin stars. But then in 1999, at the height of his success, he decided to opt out of the Michelin star game and he decided to retire. And what he said was, I gave Michelin inspectors too much respect and I belittled myself. I had three options. I could be a prisoner of my world and continue to work six days a week. I could live a lie and charge high prices and not be behind the stove, or I could give my stars back, spend time with my children. And reinvent myself. And he was the first three star chef in history to shut down and walk away. And what Luke writes in the book is that each of us has our own version of a Michelin star system. We can easily find ourselves, like a French chef, wanting stars, marks of status and prestige, badges of honor. Naming the mimetic forces at work in the systems in which we operate is an important first step towards making more intentional choices. Choices like, for me, my own Michelin stars have evolved a lot through my life. In school it was like exam scores and like the year group rankings and like university admissions and all that kind of crap. In medical school, it was academic achievements and like first class degrees and like publications. Then it became like YouTube followers and views and like ad revenue and like New York Times bestseller list status and, you know, all that kind of stuff. And so once we've identified what are our own personal Michelin stars that we are chasing after and feeling behind that we're not, that we haven't acquired yet, we can ask ourselves a few questions. Are these measures actually aligned with my thick desires? Which ones am I pursuing because. Because others value them, not because I do. And which ones would I happily give up if they conflicted with what truly matters to me? Now, this exercise isn't about rejecting all external measures because some of them might align perfectly with whatever your own authentic goals are. But it's really about having more of an awareness of the hidden scorecards that we often use to measure our life and to make ourselves feel like we are behind. All right. Now, once we've identified these thick and thin desires and our own Michelin stars, we come to tip number three, which is to set boundaries with unhealthy mimetic mind models. Now, there are various ways of doing this boundary setting thing. You could set digital boundaries so you could unfollow or mute people on social media who trigger these unhealthy feelings of inadequacy or unhealthy comparison. There are various people, for example, who I used to follow in the world of entrepreneurs who show off flashy cars and flashy watches. But after reading this book, I decided to unfollow a bunch of them because I know it is not good for my soul and for my life for me to start wanting fancier cars or fancier watches. I'm perfectly content with my Apple watch and my whoop Batman. And I really do not need to even see any content about the world of like $10,000 $100,000 watches. I have friends, for example, who follow this Content around cars and watches. And because they follow the content, they're interested in the thing they desire. I don't know, the latest Porsche, whatever the thing is, or the latest Lamborghini, whatever the thing is, or the latest Patek, whatever the thing is. And they have more of a sense of feeling behind because they have not yet acquired these symbols. And so in many ways you can curate your own social media feeds. If we take it as given that the people we follow on social media are going to be models of desire, whether we like it or not, we can just choose to unfollow the people that are prompting us to have unhealth or unwholesome desires. You could create a mental boundary. So, for example, when you find yourself feeling behind, you can ask yourself, you know, take a little bit of a pause to ask yourself, maybe journal on this. Why am I feeling behind right now? Is it because I'm chasing a desire that is authentically mine? Or is it because I'm chasing a desire that belongs to someone else? You can even set physical boundaries. Like you can actually get physical distance from hanging out with the sorts of people that inspire this sort of envy or jealousy or like desires that you don't want to have. The other thing he talks about is that we often think a lot about experts and we kind of trust the opinion of experts. Experts. But there's a, there's a fun little quote for your consideration. Experts play an increasingly prominent role in our society. But what makes an expert a degree, A podcast? Increasingly, experts are crowned mimetically, like fashion. Find sources that have stood the test of time, be wary of self proclaimed and crowd proclaimed experts. And here we go. Here's the real kicker. It's less likely that experts will be mimetically chosen in the hard sciences, physics, maths, chemistry, because people have to show their work. But it's easy for someone to become an overnight expert on productivity merely because they got published in the right place. Place. Oh, Luke, love it, Love that. And then finally, after that bombshell, we come to tip number four, which is to create positive flywheels of desire. And this is one of my favorite ideas in the book, the idea that we can intentionally create momentum around whatever our own authentic desires are. And what he says in the book is that the choices we make today affect the things we'll want tomorrow. So the example in the book is that you could say, for example, I want to start working out because my friend started a new program and looks great. That makes me want to eat better. So I don't need negate my hard work at the gym that makes me want to turn down social invites involving late nights and alcohol and unhealthy food. Therefore, I want to go to the gym in the morning instead of feeling hungover. And that means I want to spend more time doing productive work. For example, in this sense, you're taking a mimetic desire like I want to look good like my mate does. But because the flywheel that you can create around it is positive, it will improve your life rather than worsen your life. Now, understanding mimetic desire doesn't mean that you will never again feel like you are falling behind, but it does hopefully give us the awareness to pause and ask ourselves, am I really running my own race or am I just feeling behind in someone else's race? And the main thing I've really taken away from the book is that when we focus on our thick desires, like the ones that have been with us for years and the ones that energize rather than drain us, then that feeling of falling behind starts to go away because we're no longer measuring our life against external models and external other people's definition of success, but we are measuring it against the things that truly matter to us. And then hopefully we can use those desires as a way of setting positive goals and patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come rather than choosing to feel bad because like, we're not quite there yet. If you like this video, you will definitely enjoy reading the book. I'll put a link to it down below. And related to the feeling of feeling behind is the feeling of feeling lost, which it seems like a big chunk of people who watch this channel sometimes feel. And so if you're interested, I have another book club episode where we break down the feeling of why you might feel lost in life and what to do about that, which is somewhat related to the idea of feeling behind, but a little bit different. So check that video out over there if you are interested. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next one.

The video explores the concept of ""mimetic desire""—imitating others’ wants—as a root cause of feeling ""behind"" in life. Using insights from Luke Burgis' book *Wanting*, it explains how desires are shaped by social comparisons (e.g., peers or celebrities) and offers strategies to differentiate authentic ""thick desires"" from externally influenced ""thin desires."" Actionable tips include setting boundaries with unhealthy influences, identifying personal ""Michelin stars"" (status symbols), and cultivating positive desire cycles. The host, Ali Abdaal, ties these ideas to personal anecdotes and promotes self-awareness to align goals with intrinsic values.

**Chapter Summaries:**  
**[00:16-35:24] Increasingly, we seem to have this feeling that we are falling behind**  
The video introduces the pervasive feeling of ""falling behind"" in career, relationships, or milestones. This stems from comparing oneself to others’ achievements (point B) while feeling stuck at point A. Ali distinguishes between productive goal-setting and toxic self-comparison, framing mimetic desire—modeling wants based on others—as the core issue. The chapter sets up the book’s focus: questioning why we want certain goals rather than how to achieve them.  

**[00:35-02:02] The feeling of feeling behind comes from mimetic desire**  
Mimetic desire, coined by philosopher René Girard, is illustrated through a story of envy toward a friend’s promotion. Burgis categorizes mimetic models into ""Celebristan"" (celebrities/influencers) and ""Freshmanistan"" (peers, family). While Celebristan inspires aspiration, Freshmanistan triggers direct competition (e.g., salaries, milestones), fueling inadequacy. Ali reflects on mimicking peers’ academic/career goals, highlighting how proximity intensifies mimetic rivalry.  

**[02:03-04:39] Part 2: What is mimetic desire and where does it come from**  
This chapter delves deeper into mimetic theory, explaining how desires are contagious and socially constructed. Burgis’ ""Celebristan vs. Freshmanistan"" framework is expanded: Freshmanistan’s comparisons are more emotionally charged due to relatability. Ali shares how his shift to entrepreneurship introduced new mimetic traps (e.g., comparing app growth rates). While mimetic desire isn’t inherently negative, unchecked imitation of others’ goals leads to unfulfilling pursuits.  

**[04:39-58:56] Brilliant is a wonderful learning platform...**  
A sponsored segment promoting Brilliant, an interactive learning platform. Ali praises its focus on active learning (e.g., AI courses) over passive consumption. He ties this to personal growth, contrasting mindful education with social media’s mimetic pitfalls.  

**[58:56-12:58] Setting goals can become counterproductive when chasing meaningless goals**  
Ali critiques modern goal-setting culture, arguing that blindly chasing mimetic goals (e.g., wealth, status) breeds self-criticism. He stresses *choosing* goals aligned with authentic desires, referencing his journaling process to separate intrinsic wants from external influences. Burgis’ quote—“goals can turn into instruments of self-flagellation”—anchors this discussion.  

**[12:58-25:57] How do we actually chase meaningful desires? Identify thick vs. thin desires**  
""Thick desires"" are enduring, fulfilling passions (e.g., Ali’s lifelong love of teaching), while ""thin desires"" are fleeting and mimetic (e.g., wanting a larger business after envy-inducing conferences). Journaling prompts help distinguish the two: “Would I want this if no one knew?” Ali introduces ""stories of fulfillment"" (actions yielding lasting pride) and his app, VoicePal, for guided reflection.  

**[25:57-38:20] Tip #2: Identify your Michelin stars**  
Using Michelin-starred chefs as metaphors, this chapter critiques status-chasing. Bernard Loiseau’s tragic pursuit of stars contrasts with Marco Pierre White’s choice to abandon them for personal fulfillment. Ali relates this to evolving ""stars"" in his life (grades, YouTube metrics) and urges viewers to audit which metrics align with thick desires versus external validation.  

**[38:20-51:28] Set boundaries with unhealthy mimetic mind models on social media**  
Practical steps to curb mimetic influences: unfollowing envy-triggering accounts, journaling to dissect desires, and distancing from comparison-heavy environments. Burgis warns against ""crowd-proclaimed experts"" (e.g., self-help gurus), advocating skepticism and prioritizing timeless sources. Ali shares unfollowing luxury influencers to avoid thin desires for expensive watches/cars.  

**[51:28-57:11] Create positive flywheels of desire**  
Mimetic desires can be harnessed positively. For example, a friend’s fitness routine inspiring healthier habits creates a virtuous cycle. Burgis emphasizes that today’s choices shape tomorrow’s desires. Ali concludes by advocating self-compassion: measuring progress against personal values, not others’ benchmarks.  

---  

**Key Points:**  
- Mimetic desire—imitating others’ wants—fuels feelings of inadequacy and ""falling behind.""  
- ""Thick desires"" (intrinsic, enduring) should be prioritized over ""thin desires"" (externally influenced).  
- Status symbols (""Michelin stars"") often misalign with personal fulfillment; audit their relevance.  
- Curate social/media environments to minimize unhealthy comparisons.  
- Transform mimetic impulses into positive feedback loops (e.g., fitness inspiring broader wellness).  

**Tags:** mimetic desire, goal setting, personal growth, social comparison, self-awareness  

**Insight/Outlook:**  
By cultivating self-awareness and aligning goals with intrinsic values, individuals can escape the mimetic trap, transforming ambition from a source of inadequacy into a tool for authentic fulfillment."
audio_13.mp3,"All right, so if you clicked on this video, I suspect you sometimes have the feeling that there isn't enough time, that there is too much to do and not enough time to do it in. It's that constant pressure of an overflowing to do list, or the anxiety of falling behind, or the late nights trying to catch up. Now, back in the day, I used to think that if I just found the perfect productivity system or just worked a little bit harder, that I'd finally reached that mythical state where everything felt under control. But what if I told you that that feeling of never enough time is not a problem to solve, necessarily, but a reality to accept? That is the central premise of this wonderful book, Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Berkman, which is what we are discussing in this episode of Book Club, the ongoing series where for the last five plus years, I've been distilling and discussing highlights and summaries from some of my favorite books. And by the way, if you don't know who I am, hello, my name is Ali. I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur, author of the New York Times bestseller Feel Good Productivity. These days, my day job is that my wife and I are building the productivity apps that we would like to exist in the world. And on the side, I make YouTube videos on this channel where we discuss the books so strategies, ideas, and tools that can help us be more productive, live more intentionally, and ultimately build a life we love. I have reams and reams of highlights and notes from this book, but we are going to focus on three of them. So let's dive into key point number one. You will never actually get on top of everything. And I'm going to read a little quote from the first chapter. And here he's telling the story of the teaching style of a Zen master. Her teaching style, she likes to say, was not to lighten the burden of the student, but to make it so heavy that he or she would put it down. Metaphorically speaking, lightening someone's burden means encouraging them to believe that with sufficient effort, their struggles might be overcome. They might indeed find a way to feel like they're doing enough, or that they're competent enough, or that relationships are a piece of cake. Kenneth's insight was that it can often be kinder and more effective to make their burden heavier, to help them see how totally irredeemable their situation is, thereby giving them permission to stop struggling. Oh, this is so good. This is absolutely sick. This is a insight that I have been trying to internalize for myself ever since I Read Oliver's first book for 4,000 weeks. Well, it wasn't his first book, but the first book of his that I read 4,000 weeks. It's the idea that we all simply have too much to do. And it is a fool's errand to think that we can ever get on top of everything. We will never have enough time to get through everything on our to do list. There is always more we could be doing and it's just impossible to make it all happen. And this is a profoundly liberating insight that I took away from this book. This is kind of the whole vibe throughout the whole book, throughout a lot of Oliver's writing. And I think that one area in which a lot of like self help and productivity stuff, including mine, often goes amiss, is by trying to tell you that you can do it all. It is possible, of course, you can build a business while you're kind of doing your job alongside. And if you find ways to make it fun, it might even be a little bit easy. And you can have the system to make your content creation easier while building a personal brand. And while you're doing that, you can use this system to like, track, keep track of all the things on your to do list and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that is all well and good, but at the same time it is worth appreciating that even with all of that, it is never going to feel easy. It's never going to be all done. You will never get to the end of the day feeling as if, man, I've ticked off everything on my to do list. And the benefit of all of that is. And then, then you get to relax, but you also get to accomplish more and to enjoy yourself more in the process because you are no longer so busy denying the reality of your predicament, consciously or otherwise, when we realize that the burdens that we carry, that like this desire to do all of these things and to keep all of these balls juggled in the air and to be perfectly present as a partner and to be a perfectly present parent and to be like crushing it in the day job and to be building the side hustle and to be doing all the things while keeping on top of our health and while making sure we're meditating like all of this shit that we are all trying to do, when we recognize that we're just never going to be able to do all of it, we can relax and be like, oh, okay then, well, it's impossible to do all of the stuff anyway. So I may as well. Just focus on the things that I really want to do and not worry too much about the other balls dropping to the floor and just focus on relaxing and enjoying the process rather than struggling through with this like false narrative, this false belief that it is in fact possible to get on top of everything. Now, once you've embraced this idea that you cannot in fact do everything, one of the things you might actually genuinely like to do is start your own business.

So thank you so much, Shopify, for sponsoring this video, and let's get back to it. All right now we come to key point number two that I took away from the book, which is that you don't actually have to do anything. And here I'm going to read a quote from chapter three. At some point, as you seek to spend more of your finite existence in the ways that feel most meaningful to you, the thought will inevitably occur to you that you can't make a certain choice about your time however much you'd like to, because the circumstances simply don't allow it. The obstacle could be as weighty as the belief that you can't walk away from a marriage or a dispiriting career because of the emotional or financial impact on yourself or on others. Or it might be as mundane as the notion that you can't spend half an hour on an exhilarating creative project today because there are too many emails to be answered or too many household chores that need completing first These are all valid concerns, but the idea that they eliminate all room for choice isn't entirely correct. The truth, though it often makes people indignant to hear it, is that it's almost never literally the case that you have to meet a work deadline, honor a commitment, answer an email, fulfill a family obligation, or anything else. The astounding reality is that you're pretty much free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences. I'm going to read that again. The astounding reality is that you are pretty much free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences. Ah, yes. So good. You don't have to do anything. You just need to pay the price. You just need to face the consequences of the decision that you choose to make. This might seem just a bit, a little bit semantic. It's just like, you know, we're just like doing a bit of wordplay here. But let's, let's go on. Unless you're literally being physically coerced into doing something, the notion that you have to do it in truth means that you've chosen not to pay the price of refusing. Just as the notion that you absolutely can't do something means you are unwilling to pay the price of doing it. You could quit your job with no backup plan. You could book a one way ticket to Rio de Janeiro or rob a bank, or tell your social media followers your honest views. The conservative American economist Thomas Sowell summed things up with a bleakness. I appreciate insisting that there are no solutions, only trade offs. The two questions at any moment of choice in life is what the price is and whether or not it's worth paying. This is good. This is good. Why do I like this point so much? I think it's so easy for us to think that we genuinely don't have a choice. And what this chapter tells us and what Oliver's writing tells us is that there's always a choice. Unless you're literally being like physically compelled to do something, which you're probably not if you're watching this video. So in that case, you've got a choice. You could choose to do the thing or you could choose to not do the thing. Either way, you actually have a choice. You're just making that choice based on the price that you are willing to pay. This is something I've kind of noticed in myself. I've noticed it in a lot of other people that I speak to as well. Like, we create these narratives around what we can do and what we can't do. Like I can't just quit my job. It's like, yeah, you can actually. It's just like, you know, what are the consequences of you potentially quitting your job? And usually we make these consequences loom way larger in our minds than they actually are. Oh, quick thing. So this video only actually covers three of the key points that I took away from the book, but I've actually got like 86 different highlights and a bunch more notes than could feasibly fit in this video. And so I've taken some of these extra highlights and written up some notes on this completely free study guide, the book. So if you're interested, there'll be a link in the video description to download that completely for free. By the way, if you like this video, you should definitely like buy the book. It's actually sick Laura Vanderkam, who has interviewed many working mothers for books on how to manage work and family life, frequently hears versions of the same refrain. I can't relax in the evening until the children's toys are tidied away. But the reality, of course, is that you absolutely can relax with the toys not tidied away. There is no 11pm Home inspection with someone coming around to see if all the toys are picked up, notes Vanderkam. You need only be willing to pay the price of relaxing in such circumstances, which is a less than pristine home. There's an elephant in the room here that can't be tidied away, of course, which is that the consequences of any given choice might be vastly more severe for some people than for others. This is, I think, a really, really, really important point. Like when he, when he wrote this, I was like, ah, yes, this perfectly addresses an objection I know so many people will have. There are those who'd get fired if they ignored a few emails or violently abused for a toy strown house. But these grossly unfair realities don't change the fact that each choice is always and only a matter of weighing the trade offs. If a path you'd love to take is genuinely likely to leave you destitute or seriously harmed in some other way, then you probably shouldn't take it. But for most of us, if we're being honest with ourselves, the temptation is often to exaggerate potential consequences so as to spare ourselves the burden of making a bold choice. Here's another nice line might be relevant to you as well. It's a particular peril among the progressive minded, I've noticed, to take the fact that a given choice might be unfeasible for the underprivileged as a reason not to make it yourself. But unless it's you who's underprivileged, that's an alibi, not an argument. I love that I sort of laughed out loud when, when I. When I read that paragraph a few weeks ago when I first read this book. There are so many people I know who have told themselves the story, I can't just quit my job. And if you ask them, like, why can't you just quit your job? They will say something like, well, I've got to put food on the table or whatever the thing is, like, okay, but you've got plenty of savings and you could, like, you know, your business is doing okay and you could always get another job if the business doesn't work out, etc, etc, so, like, what's really the problem? And then they'll say some variation of, but some people can't just quit their jobs. Some people are literally on the poverty line, and if they quit their jobs, their families really would starve. Okay, are you, are you one of those people? Are you on the poverty line where if you quit your job, your family would literally starve? Probably not. If you're watching this video. Probably not. Maybe you are, but probably not. If you're like the average person who watches this channel. If you're like 100% of the people I speak to, probably not. Just because there are some people out there that don't have like a financial safety net from their parents or can just go home to live with a family or whatever. The thing is, just. Just because that's true for some people doesn't necessarily mean it's true for you. All right, next up, we have key idea number three from chapter 14, which starts off with a nice Haitian proverb, beyond the mountains, more mountains. The author and podcast host Sam Harris recalls being at lunch with a friend, moaning on about the various problems he was confronting in his work when she interrupted him mid flow. Were you really expecting to have no more problems at some point in your life? She asked. Harris realized with a start that he had been subconsciously proceeding on the basis that such a time would eventually arrive. I was tacitly assuming that I should be able to get rid of all my problems, he recalled later. Even though this sounds ridiculous, that was implicit to my thinking and my emotional life, to the way I was meeting each new problem. He's surely far from alone. I suspect that most of us, except perhaps the very Zen or the very elderly, move through our days with a similar, if largely unconscious, assumption that at Some point, maybe not soon, but eventually we'll make it to the phase of life which won't involve confronting an endless fusillade of things to deal with. Harris goes on to say that life is an unending series of complications, so it doesn't make sense to be surprised by the arrival of the next one. The magnitude of the problem might surprise you, but the fact that new complications in your life are arising hour by hour is absolutely to be expected. So, for example, let's say you're like most people who watch this channel and you have a job that you don't particularly like. Oh, maybe you like it a little bit, but like, you feel on a Monday night you're like, I don't really want to go to work the next day or whatever. You might think that, like, the way to get over that series of problems related to your day job is to start your own business, right? Because fun, freedom, fulfillment, flexibility, financial abundance, all of the stuff. But what you're doing is you're swapping your nine to five problems for another set of 24, seven problems when you start your own business. And then when you start your own business, they'll be like, oh, shit, okay, cool. Right now I have problems in my business, but once I get a certain amount of revenue, then I'll be able to hire my first employee and then I'll have a problem free life because the employee will take care of the problems. Then you hire an employee and you realize, oh, now I deal with a whole different set of problems in that I'm now a manager and trying to manage someone and helping them do the stuff and thrive in the workplace and then dealing with their problems as well. And then you think, well, maybe once I get to like, I don't know, seven figures in revenue, I'll be able to hire a general manager who'll be the manager for the employees. And now you're dealing with the problem of having seven figures of payroll, so you have to make a million quid a year to just break even before you even pay yourself anything. What you're doing in this whole process is you're swapping out one series of problems for another series of problems and another, and another and another forever. What I love about this is like, life will never be problem free. There are always going to be problems that arise. And so given that we now know this, we don't need to be so surprised when they do arise. Oliver goes on to say, it takes only a little further reflection to see that we wouldn't really want life to be. Otherwise, it would be nice to be able to skip the scariest or most overwhelming problems. But to face no problems at all would leave you with nothing worth doing. So you might even say that coming up against your limitations and figuring out how to respond is precisely what makes a life meaningful and satisfying. There's a clue to be found in the leisure activities to which so many of us gravitate after a workday spent resenting our problems. We play board games or watch police dramas or learn musical instruments or try a hand at cooking new dishes. None of which would be any fun if it weren't for the problem solving involved. And so swiftly there comes an unclenching if I no longer have to fight against the sheer fact of encountering problems, because that's a battle I'll never win, I get to dive more fully, perhaps even with relish, into the problems I actually have. I am free to aspire not to a life without problems, but to a life of ever more interesting and absorbing ones. Oh, love that. Beyond the mountains, there are always more mountains. At least until you reach the final mountain before your time on earth comes to an end. In the meantime, few things are more exhilarating than mountaineering, man. Love it. That's great. That's actually great. No, problems are always gonna arise and that's okay. And so when they do arise, we don't need to clench so hard at like, huh? I'm so surprised that a problem arised. It's like, of course it was gonna arise. Of course there's gonna be problems. Like, what do we expect that we're gonna have a life without problems? It's like, it's fine, let's just go with it. Let's try and lean into the fact that this problem has arisen and see what we can do about it. Now, if you enjoyed the stuff in this video, you will definitely wanna check out the book. It is very good. I'll link it down below. And if you're interested in some of the philosophi learned during my time as a doctor, which actually do vibe with some of the stuff in this book and Oliver Berkman's writing, check out this video over here where I talk through the triage method of how to manage your time.

620564-873348: Sam Harris says life is an unending series of complications","Summary:  
Ali Abdaal discusses Oliver Burkeman’s book *Meditations for Mortals*, emphasizing that the feeling of ""never enough time"" is a reality to accept, not a problem to solve. Key ideas include embracing the impossibility of doing everything, recognizing freedom in choice (with consequences), and accepting life as an unending series of challenges. The video blends philosophical insights with practical examples, including a sponsorship segment for Shopify.  

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:03] Ali: Never enough time is a reality for many of us**  
Ali introduces the pervasive anxiety of time scarcity and shares his past belief that productivity systems could solve it. He reframes this as a reality to accept, inspired by Burkeman’s book. The chapter sets up the video’s focus: embracing limitations rather than striving for total control.  

**[01:03-03:51] Key point number one is that we all have too much to do**  
Ali explores Burkeman’s argument that productivity culture falsely promises we can “do it all.” Using a Zen parable, he explains that accepting the impossibility of completing everything liberates us from guilt. The chapter critiques self-help narratives that overpromise ease, advocating instead for focusing on meaningful priorities and letting go of perfectionism.  

**[03:51-04:46] Shopify is a wonderful commerce platform that allows you to start and manage a business**  
A sponsorship segment highlighting Shopify’s tools for entrepreneurs. Ali shares his personal use of Shopify for past ventures and encourages viewers to try the platform via a free trial.  

**[04:46-08:16] Laura Vanderkam: You don't actually have to do anything**  
Burkeman’s idea that all actions are choices with consequences is unpacked. Ali reads quotes emphasizing that obligations (e.g., work deadlines, chores) are trade-offs, not mandates. Laura Vanderkam’s example of tidying toys illustrates how societal pressures create false “must-dos.” The chapter challenges viewers to confront their fear of consequences.  

**[08:17-10:20] The consequences of any given choice might be vastly more severe for some people**  
Acknowledging privilege, this chapter argues that while systemic inequalities affect consequences, most people exaggerate risks to avoid tough choices. Burkeman critiques using others’ hardships as an excuse for inaction. Ali adds that financial stability often allows more freedom than people admit, urging honest self-assessment.  

**[10:20-14:33] Sam Harris says life is an unending series of complications**  
Ali discusses Burkeman’s Haitian proverb (“Beyond the mountains, more mountains”) and Sam Harris’s realization that life will always involve problems. Examples include swapping career struggles for entrepreneurial challenges. The chapter reframes problems as sources of meaning, encouraging viewers to embrace challenges rather than resent them.  

Key Points:  
- Accepting time scarcity liberates us from the futile pursuit of “doing it all.”  
- Every action is a choice with trade-offs; consequences, not obligations, dictate decisions.  
- Life’s problems are inevitable, but engaging with them creates purpose and growth.

Insight/Outlook: Embracing limitations and reframing problems as opportunities can lead to a more intentional, fulfilling life free from the tyranny of “perfect” productivity."
audio_14.mp3,"All right, so if you clicked on this video, then you probably hate your job to some degree, which is a tough situation to be in because we need to work, right? You've got to work to make money. And it's really more like half of your life. When you're in your prime working years, where you're working Monday through Friday and maybe sometimes on weekends, there is a lot of time that we spend either working or thinking about work or commuting to work. And based on polls that I've done with my audience, a lot of people have this feeling of like, man, I'm spending all these hours related to work and I just don't really enjoy the thing that I'm doing now in that situation, the Internet will feed us broadly, two different options. Option number one is you've just got to suffer. It's called work for a reason. Work is not supposed to be enjoyable. It's just capitalism, it's just government, it's a system. There's nothing you can do about it. You might as well just sort of grin and bear it. And then option number two that is often peddled by online influencer type people, including me, in fairness, is that, hey, if you don't like your job, it's an option to start your own business. You can strike out on your own and build your own business, and you'd have fun, freedom, flexibility, financial abundance. But the honest truth is that while I do think the entrepreneurship path is good for a lot of people, it is actually not for everyone. And there is a third option, which is what we're going to talk about in this video now, if you're new here, hello, my name is Ali and I used to be a doctor. Where I didn't particularly enjoy my job, I enjoyed aspects of it, but, like, broadly didn't quite enjoy it. And so at the time, while I was working as a doctor, I did a bunch of research into trying to figure out, okay, what are the things I can do to make this a lot more fun? I put a bunch of those insights into my New York Times bestselling book, Feel Good Productivity. And through applying those various insights and getting to a point where I didn't quite hate my job, I eventually built a business that allowed me to quit the job. And I've been making YouTube videos here since 2017, sharing the strategies, tools, books, ideas, and stuff that can help us build a life that we love. And so we are going to break this video down into four parts. Firstly, we're going to look at some of the fun Factors that drive job satisfaction as a sort of top level overview. And then we're going to dive into the three different paths that you can follow if currently you hate your job. So let's get into it. Understanding job satisfaction. Okay, so what actually makes people enjoy their jobs? Is it the salary? Is it the perks? Is it the office environment? Well, a bunch of research shows that those things are important, but there are also much deeper factors that are at play. Now, there is a wonderful book by Daniel Pink called Drive that looks at what are the factors that drive intrinsic motivation. So in a work context, it's where you actually want to be doing the job. You're not just doing it for the money. And broadly, Dan Pink tells us that this comes down to three key things. The first one is autonomy, which is the freedom to decide how you do your work. Secondly, we have mastery, where you are learning and getting better at the thing. And thirdly, we have purpose, which is the sense that what you do has some kind of meaningful impact on other people. So we are striving for autonomy, mastery and purpose. But the catch is that you don't often get all of those things from day one by default. And this is where we can cite another book. This is so Good They Can't Ignore youe from Cal Newport. And this book basically dismantles the idea that, like, follow your passion is how you find a career that you love. Instead, what Cal Newport argues in the book is that if you want these elements of autonomy and mastery in particular in your job, then the way you do that is you become really good at the thing, even if you're not passionate about the thing. And by virtue of becoming good at it, you've got the mastery component, which drives intrinsic motivation. But also by virtue of you becoming really good at the thing, you become way more valuable. You develop what he calls career capital. You are then able to cash in that career capital to get things like autonomy and flexibility. So this is kind of what we're trying to go for. If you don't enjoy your job, you probably are missing some elements of autonomy, mastery and or purpose. And yes, what you could do is just quit the job and start a business that hopefully gives you all these things. But in this video, I want to share some actionable advice that's not in the realm of you should just start your own business that might help you incorporate a little bit more of these intrinsic motivation drivers into your work. The three paths to improving your job satisfaction. All right, so if we know that what we want to aim for is autonomy, mastery and purpose. Then there are basically three general parallel paths that we can follow to improve our job satisfaction. Firstly, we have the short term path where you make tactical adjustments to improve your daily experience. Secondly, you have the long term path where you are building this career capital that you can hopefully eventually cash in for more autonomy and mastery and purpose. And then thirdly, we have the exit path, which is that if you've tried the first two paths and you still find yourself dreading work, you don't really want to try the first two paths, then we can try and design a thoughtful transition into something new. Now, I just need to flag that this video, like pretty much everything else that I make, is going to focus on things that are within your control. Of course there are going to be things outside of your control that might contribute to you hating your job. It could be a toxic workplace culture. It could be that management is unsupportive. There are maybe systemic issues in your industry. There are economic pressures that limit your options. There are family responsibilities that constrain your choices. What you personally focus on is entirely up to you, obviously. But what I'm going to focus on in this video is the stuff that for a lot of people, not everyone, but for a lot of people, is going to be under your control. And I know there are going to be some people in the comments who find that offensive. There are going to be people who say, how dare this privileged, neurotypical guy give me advice about how to improve my situation. He doesn't know my situation. My situation is uniquely tough and challenging. And you're right, I don't know your specific situation. This is a YouTube video, not a one on one, one life coach session with some kind of guru. But what I found is that even in the most constrained situations, there is usually something, even if it's something small, that we can control or influence. And so, with all that said, please do feel free to take whatever is useful from the video, adapt it to your circumstances, and feel free to completely discard or ignore what doesn't apply. All right, Path number one, the short term path. All right, so I had a conversation recently with a guy called Sahil Bloom who has written the wonderful New York Times bestseller, the Five Types of Wealth, which you should definitely check out. But in the conversation we found ourselves talking about what would we say to people who hate their jobs? I think saying you hate your job is a blanket statement that needs to be deconstructed. It is very rare that you hate 100% of your job. There are going to be components of it, people, specific actions, specific times of day, specific activities that you don't hate quite as much. You need to deconstruct your day, break down the actual day, like from start to finish. What are you doing and which parts of that are creating energy versus draining energy. Clearly in the aggregate, if you hate it, it's draining your energy. And that's fine. That's a good insight. But figuring out the parts of it that are actually creating energy for you, or at least neutral, is a useful insight that you can take into whatever's next. And that brings us to strategy number one for what to do if you hate your job, which is create an energy calendar. It's the idea that at the end of each day, you go and look at your calendar and you color code the activities from the day according to whether they were energy creating. You mark them green. Energy neutral, you mark them yellow. Or energy draining, you mark them red. By the end of a week, you have a very clear perspective on the trends. This is a very reasonable way of approaching that. I hate my job. Because you can then figure out what specific aspects of your job do you actually hate? And then what micro adjustments that might be within your control. What are the micro adjustments you can do to try and minimize the amount of red and like, have a little bit more yellow and green in our calendar? Could you change the environment where you do certain tasks? Could you read my book Feel Good Productivity and find play, power and people that make work more energizing and enjoyable? Could you have a discussion with your manager and say, hey, you know, I'm finding this aspect, look at the job to be quite draining? You know, I think I could add more value to the, you know, to my role if I were to instead do xyz. Could you try and have that conversation? It's worth remembering with a strategy that it's pretty much impossible to make your calendar look entirely green. I'm an entrepreneur and I can do what I want, and my calendar is also not entirely green. But this gives us a very tangible, practical way to improve our situation in our job slowly over time by focusing on what gives us energy and trying to get more of that stuff in our job. Now, as we're talking about in this video, one of the key ways to enjoy your job a lot more is to become someone who is good at learning new things, to become a lifelong learner, which is where Brilliant comes in. Who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard, Brilliant is a wonderful learning platform. That I've been using for the last five years and I absolutely love it. One of my issues with the modern education system is that we are taught to passively consume stuff as how we learn things. But actually there are so many research studies that show that if you really want to learn something, you've got to learn by doing rather than just consuming. And that is where Brilliant really excels. They have a bunch of interactive lessons in maths, data analysis, programming and AI. And the interactive nature of these lessons means that you are doing stuff rather than just consuming and that is how you're learning. They've got a first principles approach to learning that helps you build understanding from the ground up. And it's all crafted by an award winning team of teachers and researchers at cool places like MIT and Caltech and Google and Microsoft and many more places. Now, one thing I've personally been loving recently is their courses on AI. Obviously, AI is transforming absolutely everything about most people's professional lives. I've been using AI tools every day in my own workflow, but I never really understood how AI actually works until I started taking the courses on Brilliant. They've got a great course that helps you understand how large language models like ChatGPT actually work. And this sort of perspective is really helpful to be able to make the whole AI landscape feel a lot less overwhelming. If any of that sounds interesting and you would like to try everything that Brilliant has to offer completely free For a full 30 days, head over to brilliant.org Ali Abdaal or scan the QR code on screen or check out the link in the video description.

So there is a friend of mine who works in medicine and she found working in medicine as a junior doctor in the UK to be quite draining. But there was one thing that she did which is that she explored her curiosity. So she found that she was quite curious about how the computer hospital systems work. And like, why was it that like, you know, the IT people didn't seem to understand what was really going on with the doctors. And so she went down into the basement where the IT people lived and decided during one of her lunch breaks just to have a chat to figure out how that system worked. And she realized that, oh, she actually really enjoys this aspect of like automated digital systems change. And so by kind of treating that as a little bit of a side project, a she found way more fulfillment and energy in the day job. But secondly, she managed to craft her own role where now she's doing part time clinical work and also doing this digital transformation type stuff part time as well. Now this is a thing that's not advertised. This is an opportunity that she found by pursuing her curiosity and finding a little side project and then pulling on the thread of that side project to eventually create a job that she loves. Now, in the research in psychology where they've looked at what makes jobs enjoyable, there is this idea of job crafting. And the idea here is that in a lot of different workplaces, what you do, it does not actually have to be what is on your job description. I suspect you're not working on the assembly line in a factory with like millions of other people where you have literally zero control over what's going on. I suspect you're probably in some kind of white collar job if you're anything like most people who watch this channel. And so there's probably reasonable opportunities to craft your own job even outside of your job description. Now I've done a bunch of other videos on this channel that have more practical strategies that you can use in this short term path to find more enjoyment from your day job. I'll link some of those down below. But now let's move on to the long term path and this is where you are trying to add so much value that you become irreplaceable. But before we continue, I need to go for a Muay Thai class, so I will see you very shortly. All right, back from my Muay Thai lesson, feeling a bit sweaty, but let's continue with the video. So we are now talking about the long term path and someone who perfectly illustrates this is actually a mentor of Sahil and that is the CEO of Apple. Tim Cook has been one of my mentors for a long time and he didn't start his own business. He rose through the ranks at IBM over a long period of time and created a ton of value and was a fast rising star there. Then he went and joined a random computer upstart called Compaq where Steve Jobs looked at his resume, thought he was interesting and brought him in to work on things at Apple. There he created a ton of value for everyone that he encountered and continued to rise up until he became CEO. And now today he's a billionaire, had nothing to do. He didn't start his own business. He didn't have some like massive new idea for some product or some new thing. Some of the richest People in the world worked their way up through other people's businesses. Paul Allen Right. Like there are people that have done this over long, long periods of time. Obviously Tim Cook, the billionaire CEO of Apple, is a, you know, extreme case. But I think the point here is very valid that you don't necessarily need to go off and start your own business. And as much as I'm in favor of everyone who wants to start a business to believe that they can do it and actually give it a go because it might succeed, I know there are plenty of people who follow this channel who don't necessarily want to start their own business. For most people, the best path to building financial wealth is to create a ton of value at your job so that you are irreplaceable, so that people pull you into different opportunities, so that you rise up, so that you can continue to accelerate your path to income generation. But in a business, in someone else's business, you don't need to be an owner of that. So the idea behind the long term path here is that if you want to create career capital and you want to be able to cash in that career capital for, for autonomy, mastery, purpose, doing more interesting and energizing things, the goal is to become absolutely irreplaceable in your work, to add loads of value, and then over time you can cash in that value for the things that you want. So let's talk about the next strategy, which is to swallow the frog for your boss. The single greatest piece of career advice I ever received is to swallow the frog for your boss. And I love that phrase because it's rather funny. And what it means is identify something that your boss hates doing, figure out how to do it, and then take it off their plate. And if you can do those three things, you immediately create value within your ecosystem. You immediately create value for your boss. Now, obviously this is not about becoming an office doormat or like doing it to the point where you feel exploited or whatever, but it is a very easy way of adding value if you're unsure how to do it. You could, for example, ask your boss or your manager, what are your least favorite tasks that I could take off your plate? What would it look like if I was twice as good at my job as I currently am? Another one might be, you know, what would I have to do in the next six months to make you delighted to give me a 50,000 pound raise? And you don't have to do the things on the list, but at least it then gives you the information. It shows you what the map looks like. And if you're watching this and you have your own direct reports or you lead a team, imagine how great you would feel if someone on your team asked you that question. It's just that most people don't think in this way because I think we're sort of subconsciously trained that, like, you know, you should only do the things that you are being paid to do. Like, I shouldn't go above and beyond in my workplace and add more value because I'm not being paid for it just yet. It's not that first you get the raise and then you demonstrate increased value. It's that you demonstrate increased value over a long enough period of time. And now you've become irreplaceable to the point where you have way more leverage when it comes to campaigning for a raise or a promotion or a corner office or more flexibility or whatever. The thing is, if that sounds weird, if you. If that, like, makes you think, no, that's not true. It's not true in my workplace. I really recommend reading the book so Good They Can't Ignore youe by Cal Newport, where he cites a bunch of research that backs up this point. Strategy number four, Become the person who figures it out. Now, there is a specific type of person that every team wants to have and that every company wants to keep. And this single reputation can accelerate your career faster than almost anything else. And it also means that you can cash this in in exchange for flexibility or mastery or a new area of work or whatever you might want to do. I think the easiest way to create value is to just become someone who has a reputation for figuring it out. Meaning there's a whole lot of stuff early in your career that you're going to be handed that you have absolutely no idea how to do. Someone gives you something and your imposter syndrome bells start going off because you've never done it before, and you start thinking that you're not capable of doing it. If you can build a reputation as being someone who can just figure those things out, that is, do some research, ask a couple key questions, do the work, and get the job done, you will constantly be given new things. I see this in my own team all the time. Like the people in my team who have the reputation for being able to just take anything and figure it out. Those people are given way more opportunities beyond what's on their job description. And generally those are the more interesting things that we, as a growing business, are doing. If you have a reputation for being able to take something and figure it out, or like, you know, figuring out out how to use AI to enhance like the productivity of your work or your team or like literally anything. It's so much effort for your workplace or your manager to try and hire someone else to do the thing. If they could give it to someone on their team who is able to figure stuff out, that just adds way more value over the long term. Especially in the era of ChatGPT and Claude and all these other AI tools, it's increasingly possible to basically just figure anything out. And even if you don't actually end up solving the problem, the fact that you have demonstrated the ability to give it a go and like have shown you're working and have reported back to your manager or your boss about how you attempted to solve the problem, even that alone is going to make them feel as if you are irreplaceable, which makes you feel good because it's super nice when your boss likes you and values you, as you know. And it also builds the career capital that you can then cash in to hate your job a little bit less. Then we have the next strategy, which is to broaden your definition of compensation. Now, when most people think about what they are getting from their job in exchange for their hours worked, they often focus exclusively on the salary and at the sort of surface level, benefits. But often salary and benefits are not the things that make people love their jobs. Generally, the research around this shows that salary is a hygiene factor rather than a motivating factor. If the salary is bad, then it will demotivate you. But if the salary is really good, it does not actually serve as a form of motivation. Very few people say they love their work because of how much money they get paid for it. And so another way of getting more value from a job that we hate is to broaden our definition of compensation. There's also the realization, by the way, that more people need to have, especially early in your career, that compensation is not about money. You can be compensated in the form of new opportunities, you can be compensated in the form of access, you can be compensated in the form of travel, you can be compensated in the form of networks. All of those things are compensation. And viewing compensation more broadly in those early years of your career is a cheat code. So now you've put all this effort into becoming more and more irreplaceable, adding more and more value in your workplace. You're hopefully finding at this point that by actually, by adding value, you're actually not hating your job anymore because you're getting that mastery element. You're getting better at stuff. You're learning new skills, which feeds into intrinsic motivation. You're hopefully finding that as you add more and more value, you're also being given more autonomy. Because. Because generally most workplaces, most managers, most non toxic bosses are totally happy to give autonomy to someone who's doing a good job. You might even find that you get the glow of recognition. Like if you are someone that your boss absolutely loves, you are going to have a way better time at work in a non weird way compared to someone who's, you know, like, you know, the boss kind of doesn't really like you. The boss kind of thinks you're a bit shit. It's like looking for any reason to replace you. That's a really, really stressful place to be. Yeah. The idea is that there are going to be long periods of time when you are creating more value than you are receiving in return. And then there are probably going to be long periods of time when you are receiving more value than you create. And the idea is that over really long stretches of time those two balance out. And it's sort of like if you have an upward line, you're going to be going above and below that line over long periods of time. But the hopeful point is that it's all going up in the aggregate. But then once you become the sort of person who adds all of this value and hopefully you're hitting your job less. Our next strategy is to dive through the cracked doors. Now the idea here is that some of the most transformative career opportunities that can completely change the trajectory of your career and also help you enjoy your work way more, which is fundamentally what this video is about. Those opportunities, opportunities are often not presented to you on a silver platter. They tend to come in the form of a cracked door. There are going to be opportunities in your career and in your life that present themselves as a tiny little crack in a door. And your sole responsibility is to figure out how to throw yourself headfirst through that door at that opportunity. I'll give you an example of that. These two young guys that were pitching me on wanting to run my TikTok account, they asked for a meeting. I said, I'm not really doing phone calls right now. Whatever. I was punting it, I wasn't that interested. Then they said, we're gonna be in New York on Tuesday. Can you grab a coffee and just meet in person? I was gonna be in New York on Tuesday. So I said, sure. They came up, we met, hit it off, they started working on my thing. Only later did I find out they had no plans to be in New York. I had said yes and then they booked a flight to come and meet me and do that thing. Now a year plus, two years later, we're working together on a bunch of different things that actually have nothing to do with TikTok. But what they did was they identified a tiny crack in the door and they dove through it. They just jumped at an opportunity. And that is how you unlock those sort of non linear asymmetric things in life. It's by keeping your eyes peeled for what those little cracks in the door might be where you can just dive straight through it, where you can sort of just, just close your eyes and like push through and find what that unlock is going to be that leaps you to the next level. Back when I was in medical school and working towards a residency in plastic surgery, I attended this conference where there were a bunch of plastic surgeons hanging out and I was having lunch with a few of them and one of them mentioned that they were part of this plastic surgery charity that kind of goes around the world doing reconstructive surgery on people in like low income countries for free as like a charity thing. And then someone in the group asked like, oh, what's the website like, how can I find out more? And the surgeon mentioned casually that like, yeah, you know, our online presence really sucks, our website's not very good. And immediately I recognized an opportunity because I knew how to make websites. And so I went up to that surgeon afterwards and I was like, hey, you know, I noticed that you mentioned that this plastic surgery charity website thing, you know, could do with some work. Any chance I can help with that? I've been designing websites for 10 years, I'm a medical student and I get what's going on. I understand the field of plastic surgery a little bit, I would love to help you with that. And then he was like, oh, wow, fantastic. That was a cracked door. It's not an opportunity that presents itself to run. The medical students being like, hey, we need a web designer for our plastic surgery charity. But it's like you spot the opportunity, you dive through the cracked door and it ends up morphing either into something amazing that can change your career or something that's just a bit of a cool experience. Now if we think back to most workplaces, most workplaces have way more stuff to do than there are people to do them. And generally the most interesting opportunities are not advertised as official job descriptions. And so the More, you become this person who adds a lot of value and then finds these opportunities to, for example, travel or attend an interesting thing or attend an interesting event with your boss. Or there's this unexpected problem that comes up that needs some kind of solution. If you can, like, dive through that crap door, you further cement your reputation as being someone who can figure stuff out, someone who's irreplaceable to the organization, and you end up enjoying your job a lot more as well. All right, so maybe you've tried a couple of these things and you still absolutely, really freaking hate your job. You've done the energy calendar, and you realize that there's nothing you can do to make the job feel more energizing and enjoyable. That brings us on to path number three, which is the exit path. And my single biggest recommendation here would be to not quit your job to start a business. Instead, do the side hustle experiment. Can you try and start your first business or your first two or three businesses as a bit of a side hustle while you have a day job so that over time, as you're tweaking your job so that it sucks a little bit less, can you be building up your own exit plan? I think some people are very well suited to starting and building their own businesses, but I don't think everyone should go and start their own business. And maybe that's a hot take. That's hot take. I don't think every single person is set up to be an entrepreneur because entrepreneurship at the end of the day is waking up in the morning and being willing to chew glass over a long period of time and crawl through the mud on crappy problems. It's glamorized as, like, oh, look at all these rich people that made all this money. But it's survivorship bias. At the end of the day, you don't hear about all the entrepreneurs that failed and then had to go and figure out how to scrap. And if you're interested in my honest advice for someone who wants to start their first business, then you can check out that video over there, which will break it down in terms of, like, the five key myths that hold most people back and how to go about it. If, for example, you have a day job. So thank you so much for watching. I hope you got value from this video, and I'll see you hopefully in the next one.

**Chapter Summaries:**  

**[00:00-01:39] If you're currently working, then you probably hate your job**  
Ali introduces the common struggle of hating one’s job, contrasting societal advice to “grin and bear it” with the influencer-driven push toward entrepreneurship. He presents a third option: improving job satisfaction through intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose). Ali shares his background as a doctor who transitioned to entrepreneurship by first enhancing his work experience.  

**[01:39-03:15] If you don't enjoy your job, you probably are missing some intrinsic motivation**  
Drawing on Daniel Pink’s *Drive*, Ali explains the three pillars of intrinsic motivation: autonomy (control over work), mastery (skill development), and purpose (meaningful impact). He cites Cal Newport’s concept of “career capital”—becoming irreplaceably skilled to negotiate better work conditions—and challenges the “follow your passion” myth, advocating skill-building first.  

**[03:15-04:54] The three paths to improving your job satisfaction are entirely up to you**  
Ali outlines three paths: 1) **Short-term**: tactical adjustments (e.g., task reallocation), 2) **Long-term**: building career capital for leverage, and 3) **Exit**: transitioning thoughtfully. He acknowledges systemic workplace issues but focuses on controllable factors, urging viewers to experiment with small changes.  

**[04:54-06:52] What do you say to people who say they hate their jobs**  
Ali and Sahil Bloom advise deconstructing job hatred using an “energy calendar” (coding tasks as green/yellow/red). By identifying energy-draining tasks, viewers can negotiate role adjustments or environmental changes. Ali promotes his book *Feel Good Productivity* and introduces Brilliant as a learning tool.  

**[06:52-08:05] Brilliant is a great learning platform that helps you become lifelong learners**  
A sponsored segment highlighting Brilliant’s interactive courses (AI, programming, math) as a way to build mastery. Ali praises its hands-on approach and offers a 30-day free trial, linking lifelong learning to career growth.  

**[08:05-09:59] IT strategy number two, energizing side projects**  
Ali encourages “job crafting” through curiosity-driven side projects. He shares a doctor’s story: exploring hospital IT systems led to a hybrid clinical/digital role. This strategy boosts fulfillment and expands skill sets, aligning with intrinsic motivation.  

**[09:59-11:38] Sahil says the best path to building financial wealth is to create value at work**  
Using Tim Cook’s career as an example, Ali argues that adding disproportionate value (e.g., solving critical problems) builds career capital. This leverage enables negotiating autonomy, raises, or promotions, even within traditional employment.  

**[11:38-15:01] Identify something your boss hates doing and then take it off their plate**  
The “swallow the frog” strategy involves taking over tasks your boss dislikes to become indispensable. Ali advises asking managers, “What would make you thrilled to give me a raise?” to align efforts with organizational goals. He also stresses becoming a “figure-it-out” person using AI tools to solve unassigned problems.  

**[15:01-17:05] One way to get more value from a job that you hate is to broaden compensation**  
Compensation isn’t just salary—it includes networks, travel, and skill-building. Early-career focus should prioritize non-monetary gains (e.g., mentorship, unique opportunities). Ali notes salary is a “hygiene factor”: sufficient pay prevents dissatisfaction but doesn’t motivate.  

**[17:05-20:19] There are opportunities in your career and life that present themselves as cracked doors**  
Ali shares examples of “cracked doors”: small, unadvertised opportunities (e.g., volunteering skills for a charity website, pitching ideas proactively). He urges viewers to aggressively pursue these moments, as they often lead to asymmetric career growth.  

**[20:19-21:26] Don't quit your job to start a business; do the side hustle experiment**  
Ali warns against quitting prematurely, advocating for side hustles to test ideas risk-free. He critiques survivorship bias in entrepreneurship and encourages gradual transitions while refining job satisfaction through earlier strategies.  

---

**Key Points:**  
- Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose) is key to job satisfaction.  
- Short-term fixes (energy audits, side projects) and long-term value creation (“career capital”) can transform work experience.  
- Compensation includes non-monetary benefits like networks and skill-building opportunities.  
- Seizing “cracked door” opportunities accelerates career growth.  
- Side hustles mitigate entrepreneurship risks while maintaining income.  

**Tags:** job satisfaction, career development, intrinsic motivation, side hustles, productivity  

**Insight/Outlook:** By strategically focusing on controllable factors—skill development, value creation, and opportunistic pivots—individuals can redefine their work experience, unlocking growth within traditional employment or entrepreneurial ventures."
audio_15.mp3,"My goal here is simple. I want to convince you to launch your own personal website. That is it. Starting my personal website was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Back in 2016, I bought a domain, I set up a simple website, and I had no idea just how much it would change my life. That website directly landed me opportunities when I was a medical student and when I worked as a doctor. The personal website even played a role in helping me meet the person who eventually became my wife. Because of that website, I started this YouTube channel eight years ago. And thanks to this YouTube channel and to you guys for watching the content and engaging with the content, I am now able to live my absolute dream life. I genuinely believe, believe that no matter where you are in life, whether you are just starting out or you're aiming for a promotion in the corporate ladder or whatever, or you're dreaming of starting your own business, a personal website can completely change your career and your life. Hold up, wait a minute, wait a minute. A website costs time and money to set up and maintain. I can see how that might be useful if you've got a business. But I am just a corporate employee working at an accounting firm. Why the hell should I have a personal website? Yes, a personal website does cost a little bit of time and money. A few dollars a month, maybe a weekend or two to get it up and running. But here's the thing. Over time, I am convinced that having a website is one of the best investments you can make in yourself and in particular your career. So, Harry, if I could convince you that the time it takes to set up your website and maintain it and the small amount of money you're paying each month for your website, if I could show you that that's probably going to give you a massive return on your investment, would you then consider starting your own personal website? You know what? I'm open to hearing your perspective on this. I got to tell you, I'm a pretty skeptical guy. I don't think you're going to be able to convince me. Maybe the personal website thing worked for you, but I'm just a lowly corporate employee and I don't think it's going to work for me. But I'm open to hearing your case. Fantastic, Harry. So the case I'm going to make for starting a personal website for you as a corporate employee or whoever else happens to be watching this video is that there are three levels to having a personal website. So let's start with level one, the online cv. All right, Harry, so let's start with a question. Do you think it's important for you to have an up to date LinkedIn profile? Yeah, of course. I work in a corporate. Everyone's got a LinkedIn profile. It's how you get noticed by recruiters and potential employers. It's kind of like your digital resume. Exactly. But here's the thing. A personal website is sort of like your LinkedIn profile on steroids. You have complete control over how it looks, what it says, how you present yourself, and it. It kind of becomes your own personal corner of the Internet. Okay, but I already have a LinkedIn profile. Why would I bother putting in the time and effort to build a personal website on top of my CV and my LinkedIn profile? That is a wonderful question. So the simple answer is that a personal website helps you stand out whether you are applying for jobs or you're being headhunted by recruiters. Sure, your LinkedIn profile and your CV are important, but let's be honest, everyone has a decent LinkedIn profile and every single person has a polished CV. Especially with AI being able to write people's LinkedIn profiles and to be able to write people's CVs. Relatively few people, though, have a personal website. Hmm. So I've been thinking about switching jobs anyway. And to be honest, the market is super competitive right now. AI is taking over. I could use something to help me stand out in the job market. But firstly, how the hell is a website supposed to do that? And secondly, what would it need to have on it if I assume that it's even possible? That is a very good question, Harry. So let me flip it back to you for a second. So you've hired associates at work, right? Like juniors who work underneath you. What do you usually look for when you're reviewing applications or interviewing people? Oh, that's easy. So by the time I see the application, HR has already screened out the ones that don't meet the basic qualifications. So when I'm looking at the applications, I'm essentially looking for two things. Firstly, would I enjoy working with the person? And secondly, are they competent enough to handle the job without me having to handhold them every single step of the way? Right, and how do you figure that out from someone's CV or LinkedIn profile? Honestly, it's pretty tough. I try to get a sense of who they are, what they're like as a person, what they're interested in outside of work, but most of the time a CV or LinkedIn profile doesn't really give me that. Exactly. Now imagine one of these Candidates happened to have a personal website. It is not just a copy and paste of their LinkedIn profile, but it's a nice website. It's got an About Me page that's got some photos of them. Maybe there's some pictures and little text and stuff that shows what they get up to outside of work. Or maybe they've written a pretty detailed blog post about their experience transitioning from a big four accounting firm to industry, sharing the lessons they learned along the way. Okay, fine. You're right. If I saw something like that, it would massively boost their chances of getting an interview. Plus, I'd have way more to talk about them during the interview. A hundred percent, man. And here's the thing. So in my experience, I've hired over 30 people. I have literally seen thousands of applications and the candidates with personal websites or any kind of online presence or personal brand, even if it's totally basic, those people are way more likely to get an interview compared to those people who are completely invisible online. And according to ChatGPT, the average person in the US applies for over 600 jobs in their lifetime. So even a tiny increase in your chances of getting hired could potentially make a huge difference over time. It's an investment that pays off. And given that it only costs a few dollars a month and a couple of weekends to set up a website, I think that's probably worth it. All right, that kind of makes sense. But does this only happen if I'm actively job hunting? Not at all. So even if you are not applying for jobs right now, having a personal website is like keeping a polished CV in your back pocket. It's like keeping your LinkedIn Prof. Up to date, just in case. Life, as you know, Harry, is somewhat unpredictable. You never know when a recruiter might reach out to you on LinkedIn or via a personal website. You never know when a former colleague that you used to work with hands your name to a hiring manager because they want you to join their firm. Or just someone within your industry or within a different industry might stumble across your website and they might see the stuff on your website and think that you're a perfect fit for their team. So having a maintained personal website is sort of like having a maintained LinkedIn profile, and it keeps you ready for those sorts of moments. Okay, so let's say I agree with you. What sort of stuff would this level one website need to have? Okay, well, at level one, your website doesn't actually need to be anything fancy. It basically just needs three pages. So an about page that has A short professional and maybe bit of personal bio. It's useful to have a resume or portfolio page, which is basically your glorified CV where you showcase your skills or your work, but you're not limited by the word count of like a one page CV or whatever. The thing is, you can actually just present it in the way that you want. And it's useful to have a contact page where people can easily reach you. So whether that's an email address or a LinkedIn profile, or Twitter or Instagram, you know, whatever the thing might be. Now obviously you, you can choose how much effort you want to put into curating this website. And just like if someone had a really well curated, really well thought out, detailed LinkedIn profile, that would help them stand out compared to a generic LinkedIn profile with not much information on it. If you take the time and effort to curate your personal website, add more stuff to it, all of that just gives employers and recruiters way more information and a stronger sense of who you actually are. Okay, so that was level one, where a website is basically a glorified online cv. What's level two, Harry? I'm so glad you asked. Level two is where your personal website becomes baby steps for building your personal brand. So tell me, Harry, you work in the corporate world. To what extent do you think it's important for you to have a personal brand? Personal brand? That whole thing again, mate, the partners at the accounting firm, they keep on banging on about this like, importance of building your personal brand. And to be honest, I kind of get the idea, you know, they're saying that your personal brand is kind of like your professional reputation. Especially in a world that's being completely disrupted by AI, People with personal brands are obviously going to stand out more than people without personal brands. They talk about how putting yourself out there on online, writing stuff on LinkedIn and different social media platforms, giving talks, maybe even writing a book, all of that stuff helps you build your personal brand. And they talk about how a personal brand can help you land clients, which is kind of the main thing that these accounting firm partners are focused on. They're focused on landing clients. And so the people with strong personal brands, you know, they're always writing on LinkedIn and writing articles and like going on TV and doing thought leadership content and even trying to do cringe YouTube videos. They're all hoping that the personal brand thing will help them land clients. Yeah, that sounds perfect. I mean, those are a lot of the benefits of building a personal brand. Have you considered building your own personal brand? Harry. Oh, yeah, I have considered it, but I just don't want to be one of those cringe people writing crap on LinkedIn. I don't want to post Instagram stories or, like, TikToks of me dancing. Like, oh, it's so cringe. Okay, Harry, firstly, no one's talking about you posting TikToks of you dancing. You know, people talking about building a personal brand are talking about sharing your knowledge, sharing what, you know, online. How does that sound? Yeah, I know. It's just. Oh. Anytime I think about putting myself out there and writing something on LinkedIn, I just feel this, like, massive internal resistance to doing the thing. And I've been, you know, I've had it on my to do list for ages. I keep on. I keep on telling myself, you know, I should really build that personal brand. I should really stop posting on LinkedIn. I just feel. It feels. Feels weird, man. Feels weird. Okay. That feeling of resistance that you are currently feeling to putting yourself out there online, let's just call it what it is. It is fear. You are afraid of putting yourself out there online, and I'm not judging. Harry. I used to be like this until I started my personal website back in 2016. I used to be terrified of putting myself out there online. I used to be terrified that if I posted something, my Facebook friends, back when Facebook was a thing, my Facebook friends are going to see it and they're going to think I'm cringe, and they're going to be like, who the. Who's this guy? Like, what does he think he's doing? Like, oh, like, you know, get back in the barrel where you belong, you weirdo. But, Harry, you know what I realized over time? It was just the fear talking. I was fundamentally afraid of what other people would think. Think about me. And therefore, I didn't put myself out there. I didn't want to stand out. You know, the tallest puppies, the first to get cut down and all of that crap. Okay, Yeah, I mean, that's exactly how I feel. You know, it's called a spade. A spade. Yeah. I'm afraid of putting myself out there because I'm worried about what people will think. How the hell does a personal website help with that? Like, surely a personal website, like, exacerbates those fears, right? It's kind of like public speaking. Most people do not enjoy putting themselves out there, and it is a muscle you have to build. And for most people, building it one small step at a time is a lot easier. When you have a personal website. No One needs to know that personal website exists. That personal website is your playground. To be able to create your own about page, to put some pictures on it, to mess around with the layout, to maybe write a few blog posts over the course of however long it takes you to get comfortable. And no one needs to know it exists. That is the crucial thing. When I started my personal website, I did not tell anyone it existed. When I started my YouTube channel, I did not tell anyone it existed. I did not post about it on Facebook, I didn't share it on LinkedIn, I didn't talk about it on Instagram. I just did the thing myself privately for a while. And then I realized, huh, this whole writing shit on the Internet thing, it's actually not that bad. And then I took a blog post and I shared it with a few trusted friends. Like the people who like really had my back. And they were like, oh man, this is quite interesting. This is quite good. I was like, oh, you know, that's not too scary. And then like the next one, I shared it with a couple of more friends and they were like, oh, you know, it's reasonable. Like three or four people read these blog posts. But it helped me get comfortable with the idea of online self expression. And if I hadn't built that personal website initially and gotten those babies to steps out of the way a year and a half later when I saw the opportunity to start a YouTube channel, I never would have taken it because it would have been terrifying. It would have been so scary to put myself out there. But I had the experience of having a website first. Okay, so it sounds like what you're saying is that if I want to build my personal brand, I obviously have to stop putting myself out there. Right? But I'm currently afraid of putting myself out there because I'm super worried about what people will think, which kind of sounds a bit weird to admit, but like, yeah, that is exactly what's happening. And you're saying that if I start a personal website, it's sort of like a private training ground where no one has to see it. It's almost like a private journal in a way. Like no one actually has to see the thing until I feel comfortable to share it with a few people one small step at a time. Yes, exactly. It is not quite like a private journal because you want to write as if people are going to see it and that gives you that little push. And you also want to actually build a website that is public so that then when you do decide to share it, there isn't this whole friction process associated with that, but essentially that's it. The website is training grounds for your personal brand. It's baby steps to getting comfortable with the idea of personal self expression. In fact, this book, show youw Work by Austin Kleon is a book I've been sharing on my YouTube channel for absolutely years. This is the book that I read back in late 2015, and this helped me get comfortable with the idea of personal self expression. He describes it as a book about self promotion for people who absolutely hate the idea of self promotion. And reading this book helped me realize I could write stuff on my personal website and it was okay sharing what I'd learned. I was just a medical student at the time, but I'd done a few things. I was like, trying to build this like, university admissions company. And so I just started writing a few blog posts sharing what I was learning along the way. And that is what made me comfortable with personal self expression. And so I owe a massive debt of gratitude to Austin Kleon for writing this amazing book. It's like super quick as well. It's like, you know, there's loads of cartoons and stuff, so, like, it's not that hard to read. But that is another massive reason why having a personal website is useful. Even if you have no followers, even if very few people see it, it will help you get comfortable with putting yourself out there. Putting yourself out there is exactly what you need to stand out in any kind of career that you're now doing, especially in a world that's being dominated by robots and AI. All right, so you're saying level one is basically where my website is my online glorified personal cv. And level two is where my website basically becomes a training ground for personal self expression to help me get comfortable with putting myself out there. What about level three? Fantastic, Harry, I'm so glad you asked. Level three is where the real magic happens, and that is where your website becomes a luck magnet. With a Level 3 website, the more you put yourself out there, your ideas, your insights and your experiences, the more you increase your surface area for luck. This is personal brand building 101. By creating and sharing valuable content that is useful for a small number of people, you give people a chance to find you and a chance to connect with you and potentially open doors to opportunities that you didn't even know existed. Okay, but how does that actually work? Like, people don't randomly stumble across websites, do they? Yeah, you're right. It's not totally random. So in theory, it might be possible for some people to find the stuff that you write. Let's say you write blog posts about your experiences in accounting or whatever. It might theoretically be possible for them to find it on search engines, but it's pretty unlikely because search engine optimization is a whole other game. In reality, there are two broad ways in which people find your stuff. So number one is you share it yourself on some kind of social platform like LinkedIn. Maybe you write a blog post about your experiences transitioning from accounting firm A to accounting firm B and like what you learned along the way or whatever the thing might be. And then you post on LinkedIn at the point where you feel comfortable, you know, sharing it to your professional network, saying, hey, I switched from accounting firm A to accounting firm B. Here are a few things I've learned. I've written them up in a blog post link down below or something like that. You're sharing it yourself so people will stumble upon your website. But then method number two of people discovering you is that other people will share your stuff if it's good. If your stuff is good and it is useful to people, then people will just have an intrinsic need to share stuff because it gives them social status points. And there have actually been plenty of cases where someone on my team has stumbled upon a random blog post written by a random person that we've never heard of because it was relevant to a challenge we were facing in our business in the moment. And then they'll share it within the team and Slack, and then me or Angus or someone else on the team will read the blog post, we'll look at the about page of the person who wrote it, we'll see that, oh, this person does freelance work. Let's hire them for a freelance consulting arrangement. And actually a lot of the people we've worked with over the years we have found because they've had personal brands and personal websites with an easy way to contact them and hire them for a freelance engagement. Okay, that kind of makes sense. But the thing that comes to mind is like, you know, what can I possibly create that would be useful? Like, I mean, I'm just a junior mid level employee at like a boring ass accounting firm. Like what kind of content would be even vaguely interesting for other people that other people might care about? All right, that is a good question. So at level one and level two, your website was mostly about you, helping people get to know you better so that you could stand out for jobs and so you could get comfortable with self expression. But at level three, you really want to focus on how can I be useful to other people? How can I show my work? So, for example, Harry, you could write some sort of educational thing, sharing lessons you've learned on your accounting journey. You've been in the workplace for a few years now. There's probably stuff that you know now that someone three years younger than you or three years junior than you in the same industry would find interesting or useful. But that's like really boring accounting stuff. Like, why would people care? Harry, you are not trying to get millions of people to like your stuff. You are not trying to go viral. You are not trying to appeal to the masses. You are trying to appeal to the small number of people who are a few steps behind you on the journey that you've just taken. So if you imagine, what do you wish you'd known three years ago? What do you wish you'd known five years ago, back when you were at university. What are the things you wish you'd known about the workplace? Those are going to be relevant to a small group of people, but they're going to be very relevant to that small group of people. I probably wouldn't do an article around, like, I don't know, five generic productivity tips, because that's kind of generic. But if you did an article on 5 Ways to Stand out when applying for a job at a big four accounting firm, having applied to plenty of those yourself, Harry, and having landed one of those jobs, that would probably be quite useful and somewhat unique. It doesn't need to be unique. There are no unique messages, but there are always unique messengers. And your way of explaining the stuff that you know, you know, something that Derek Siva says is what's obvious to you and what's boring to you can be absolutely amazing to others. That's the kind of thing we want to tap into when it comes to figuring out what kind of content to share online. Oh, man. Okay, so I can see why this would be useful to do. It just seems kind of hard, man. Like, feels like a lot of. Just feels like a lot of effort. Do I really want to go through the effort? All right, Harry, I'm going to get on my soapbox for a minute here. Everything in life is hard, right? Let's say you build a personal brand by sharing blog posts once a month about your experience in accounting. That's going to be hard. You're going to have to spend like a weekend once a month or something just doing some writing. And you'll find that writing is hard. And you have. And you have to put it out there online, that is hard. But you know what else is hard? It's hard when you get fired because AI has taken over your job. It's hard when you don't get promoted to partner at your law firm because actually everyone else has a personal brand and they're able to land clients, which is where the value of a partner is at. And all you can do, because you're invisible on the Internet, all you can do is just do people's accounts. I obviously can do people's accounts. There's tons and tons of juniors. There's loads of people, like, in different countries being okay with being paid $5 an hour to just do someone's bookkeeping or just do someone's accounts. The value in you as a human is in the fact that you can land other clients and you can build personal relationships. It's also hard to be in the position where you're not that, like, everything is hard. You just have to choose your flavor of heart. Do you want to put in the work now to build your personal brand to future proof yourself and your career in an industry that's absolutely going to be dominated by AI, or do you want the hard to come a few years down the line when you have a family and a mortgage and kids and now you're laid off because AI has taken over your job and you haven't had a personal brand to try and protect you from that revolution? Okay, fine. I get it. Calm down. You know, there's no need to keep on going on about this. I get it. Everything is hard. And I can go through the heart of building my own personal website and my personal brand now, or I can wait for myself to get disrupted and cross my fingers and hope for the best. You know, I like to take things into my own hands. I'd like to have a little bit more control than I actually do. So, like, okay, cool. Let's say I'm now sold on why I should have a website. Where do I get started? I've never built a website before. I don't know anything about this. I don't consider myself particularly technical. Like, what am I going to do? Wonderful. Let's talk about how to build a website before we actually go there. There is just one little piece of verbiage or, like, semantics I would like to just. Just comment on, which is that, Harry, you said, I don't consider myself particularly technical. Firstly, you don't need to be technical to build a website. But I'm curious, what do you mean by I don't consider myself particularly technical. Well, you know, I just like, you know, I've never really learned to code and I don't know, I just. I don't know, I just, I'm not a very tech savvy sort of person. Harry, this is holding you back. You telling yourself the story because it's just a story that you are not a technical person is 100% holding you back and is going to continue to hold you back. Especially in the AI revolution where the people that are going to keep their jobs and the people that are going to thrive are the people that know how to use AI to improve their workflow. And often those people, if they have a story that they're not particularly technical, there's going to be all of these emotional barriers and internal barriers to actually taking the steps to learn how to use AI and to learn how to use these technical tools. I think it would be very valuable for you to consider changing the story that you are telling yourself, which is that you're not a technical person and embrace the fact that you're not a technical person yet. But you can learn. You can learn how to build a website, you can learn the basics of how to code, you can learn the basics of how to make an AI agent. How do you do it? By watching YouTube videos. People have made tutorials about all of this stuff. You can do it, you can figure it out, you can become a technical person, even if you don't feel you are that already yet. Okay, fine, I get it. Yeah, that makes sense. That's cool. I'm sold. I'm going to make a website. Okay, so how do I actually go about this? I've seen there's all these different options out there. There's like hosting, there's Squarespace, there's wix, the webflow, there's Framer, there's Tom, Dick, Harry, AI. There's Notion. People building websites on notion these days. What, like which one should I choose? Okay, so this is where things can get complicated. Because you're right, there are all these different choices on how to start a website. And to be honest, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter which specific tool or which specific platform you use. But I can share my personal recommendation for you, if that's okay. How does that sound? Yeah, sure. I want to hear your personal recommendation. I want to hear what you would do if you were in my shoes. And to be honest, if I don't, if I want to look around, I can just search on YouTube, I can find Some tutorials, people have made loads of tutorials on how to build a website using all of these different platforms. Fantastic. So I'm going to give you my own personal recommendation and I have two. The first one is if I was speaking to my completely broke teenage self and I wanted a website but I was not allowed to spend a penny on it, it had to be 100% free. This is actually the position I was in when I tried to build a website as a teenager. In that case, if that's the case that you're in, which Harry, I know you're not, but in case there's people watching this video who are in that position where you literally physically cannot spend the money or cannot afford to spend the money, then my favorite free option is a website called carrd.co and there's loads of tutorials and stuff and also you can figure it out on how to build a website using Carrd. But Harry, given that you are not a broke 13 year old and you do have a job that's paying you money and you were sold on the fact that having a website is an investment in your professional Life, I would 100% recommend Hostinger, who are incidentally sponsoring this video, but I would recommend them anyway and they're very user friendly and they're also very affordable. Hostinger? Yeah, I've heard that they sponsor a lot of YouTubers like, I mean, I know they're sponsoring this video, but would you actually use Hostinger if they weren't sponsoring this video? Funny story, I actually am using Hostinger to host three of my websites. Alibda.com, pTY.com for my YouTuber Academy and ProductivityLab.com and we could choose from any website host anywhere in the world. And pretty much any website hosting company would be down to sponsor our videos as well. But my team did an in depth analysis of all of them and we landed on Hostinger. In fairness, it was a cross between Hostinger and WP Engine and they both offered basically the same service, but WP Engine was more expensive and hosting was cheaper, so we went with the cheaper option. And we've been with them for two years and we love it. And I even went out for lunch with some of their team back when I was in London and they were super nice, super friendly, they knew their stuff. So what exactly is Hostinger and how does it work? That is a great question. So Hostinger actually offers two main options of building a website. You can build a WordPress website and you can host it on Hostinger or You can use Hostinger's website builder. Okay, so what's the difference between these two options? Okay, so these are two sort of different things. So WordPress is an open source platform that powers around 43% of the Internet. And so Hostinger is a WordPress host. So on WordPress, you know, WordPress is what we use. It's more customizable. There's like hundreds of thousands of templates that people have made. There's hundreds of thousands of plugins that you can add to your site, pretty much any functionality you want, and you can literally modify anything about it, even the code, if you're comfortable with that level of control. Now, the trade off here is that there is a little bit of a learning curve. Yes, it's very easy to install WordPress, but then customizing WordPress, you know, you got to pick a theme, install some plugins, maybe tweak some settings, you know, keep it roughly up to date, which Hostinger does for you automatically anyway. Okay, so if I'm a beginner, then this website builder sounds like it's the better option. Like, why would someone choose WordPress hosting instead? So if your goal is to have a professional looking website with the least amount of hassle and friction and effort that is humanly possible, then the website builder is the way to go. This is great if you don't care about how websites work, you don't really want to learn, you just want something out of the box. But the WordPress hosting option is better if you are willing to invest a little bit of time in learning how websites work. And honestly, I personally think that Learning to use WordPress is an incredibly useful skill to have. All right. I mean, but that does sound like a lot of effort. It sounds like. I think, I think I maybe want to stick with the website builder instead. Yeah, I mean, honestly, that's totally fair. I can totally understand how as a complete beginner who's never touched a website before in your life, you want to use the website builder to get your feet wet, to get started. Also, in fairness with WordPress, back in the day, it used to be kind of annoying setting up a WordPress installation. But with hosting as business plan, it comes with unlimited SSL certificates for security. WordPress AI tools that help you create content up to five times better performance compared to basic plan and a free content delivery network that makes your site load quickly. The setup process for this is actually pretty straightforward. You choose a domain name, you install WordPress with one click and then you can use the AI builder or choose from thousands of WordPress themes. The other thing is that they've got the AI content creator tool, which helps you generate ideas. And so if you're particularly struggling with figuring out what do you actually write about, you can use the tool to help give you a few ideas. Plus, they've got really good 24. 7 customer support and tons of tutorials. So even if WordPress is a little bit more tricky to deal with, you're in good hands if you host it with Hostinger, which is exactly what me and my team. Okay, nice. That sounds reasonable. Can you show me how this works? Absolutely. I'm glad you asked. So let's go into the screen now, and I'm just going to give you a little quick walkthrough of how you could build a website using the Hostinger website builder. All right, so I'm going to go over to Hostinger and I am going to use the website builder and I'm going to pick the business website builder, because why not? And you know what? I'm going to sign up for four years because I'm committed to this. And then I'm just going to go through the signup process a few moments later. And I'm going to start by using the AI website builder. So my brand name, I'm going to say is my name, which is Harry Trotter. Describe your project or brand in a few sentences. Create a website. Okay, now what I. What do I want? I want pages and navigation. I don't even really need a homepage, but let's see. Welcome to Harry Trotter Accounting. Okay, so this is what the AI has come up with. And if I wanted to, I could add a blog page where I can now write stuff like blog posts and things. And then I can get a domain and connect my domain. So because I get a free domain as part of this hosting a plan, I can get the domain name Harry Trotter. Oh, Harry Trotter.com is available. I'm surprised that's available. Registering. And within a few minutes, using the AI features of the website builder, we have whipped up a very, very basic page. The thing with the website is that it is a little bit of a blank slate. If you wanted way more templates and way more customization, I would go for the WordPress option rather than the website builder option. But the website builder option, if you're a beginner, is a good place to get started. And you can see, you can just click around, you can add sections, you can like, you know what? I'm gonna add a Section that has, I don't know, like my cv. Perfect, Fantastic. I don't, I don't need the section that has my project. Let's just delete the whole thing. I don't climb feedback, you know, feedback, whatever. Yep, that's fine. You can, you can see that you can start to with just a few minor kind of changes. Let's get rid of that image. Don't we need that? Let's move that up there. Like you can see it's actually starting pretty reasonable, starting to look pretty reasonable. The thing that I would recommend, Harry, is that you start off with one page at a time. I think one thing that overwhelms people with websites is that especially if you use like an AI builder or something and they create these multiple pages for you, there's a home page, an about page, services, contact blog. You're like ah, crap. But like just starting with one page and getting that looking with the content and like the style that you want. And I would say probably keep it simple rather than trying to overcomplicate it. That is where you get started. And then you can always add more and more pages further down the line. All right, that all sounds very reasonable. So how do I get started? Fantastic. So if you'd like to sign up to hosting as business plan, there is a coupon code and a link in the video description if you want to check it out. And if you would like some tips on how to actually make this happen. Now you've set yourself the intention of starting a website, but how to actually follow through with it, then check out this video over here where I talk about five super easy to implement evidence based strategies that you can use to achieve any goal, including the goal of building a website. So thank you so much for watching, have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.","160-104222: I want to convince you to launch your own personal website

The video advocates for creating a personal website as a career-enhancing tool, emphasizing its role in standing out professionally, building a personal brand, and attracting opportunities. The speaker shares personal success stories, addresses skepticism, and outlines three levels of website utility (online CV, personal brand development, and ""luck magnet""). Practical steps for setup, including AI tools like Hostinger, are discussed, alongside overcoming fears of self-expression in an AI-driven world.

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:44] I want to convince you to launch your own personal website**  
The speaker introduces their goal: persuading viewers to create a personal website. They recount their own experience starting a website in 2016, which led to career opportunities, a YouTube channel, and personal growth. They argue that a website is a worthwhile investment regardless of career stage, addressing initial skepticism about cost and effort.  

**[01:44-06:09] A personal website helps you stand out when applying for jobs or prospective employers**  
The speaker debates ""Harry,"" a skeptical corporate employee, on the value of a personal website. They compare it to LinkedIn but stress its superior customization and ability to showcase personality and competence. Examples include adding blog posts or personal interests to differentiate candidates. Data on hiring preferences (e.g., candidates with websites being more interview-worthy) and long-term ROI are highlighted.  

**[06:09-07:03] The partners at the accounting firm constantly talk about building a personal brand**  
The discussion shifts to personal branding, with Harry acknowledging its importance but resisting ""cringe"" self-promotion. The speaker reframes branding as sharing expertise (e.g., writing about industry transitions) and addresses Harry’s fear of judgment, suggesting a website as a low-risk training ground for self-expression.  

**[07:03-10:53] Having a personal website helps you get comfortable with putting yourself out there**  
The speaker shares their journey of overcoming fear through incremental exposure (e.g., private blogging before public sharing). They recommend starting small, treating the website as a ""playground,"" and referencing Austin Kleon’s *Show Your Work* to normalize self-promotion. The website is framed as foundational for future confidence in public-facing projects like YouTube.  

**[10:53-19:07] Building a personal brand in an industry dominated by AI is hard**  
The speaker acknowledges the difficulty of content creation but argues it’s essential for career resilience. They urge focusing on niche, useful content (e.g., ""5 Ways to Stand Out in Accounting Applications"") rather than virality. A stark contrast is drawn between the effort of branding now versus the risks of job displacement by AI later.  

**[19:07-26:28] There are many options out there on how to build a website**  
Harry asks about technical barriers, and the speaker challenges his self-limiting belief about being ""non-technical."" They recommend platforms like Carrd (free) or Hostinger (paid), emphasizing user-friendliness. Hostinger’s AI builder and WordPress integration are demoed, with tips to start simple and iterate.  

**[26:28-26:28] Using the AI website builder can help you create a very basic website**  
A live demo of Hostinger’s AI builder walks through domain registration, template customization, and content creation. The speaker advises starting with one page (e.g., an About Me section) and expanding gradually to avoid overwhelm.  

Key Points:  
- A personal website differentiates candidates in competitive job markets by showcasing personality and expertise.  
- Building a website is a low-risk way to overcome fear of self-promotion and build confidence.  
- Sharing niche, actionable content (e.g., industry insights) attracts opportunities and future-proofs careers against AI disruption.  
- Platforms like Hostinger simplify website creation, requiring minimal technical skill.  
- Personal branding is an investment in career resilience, with long-term rewards outweighing short-term effort.

Maybe you feel like you're in a transitional state in your life right now where things seem to be changing and you're not sure if the direction of change is really what you want. And maybe you're not even sure what you really want because there's so many options out there for what you could do with your work and your life. And you don't want to waste years of your life going down the wrong path. So you end up feeling a little paralyzed. I've had these thoughts and feelings at various points in my life as well. And so in this video, I wanted to share five strategies that I've personally found really helpful that I hope you might too. From a neuroscientist who studies and writes about this stuff for a living. Embracing the fact that you are in perpetual transformation, that the person you are today is different from the person you will be tomorrow. And sometimes it can be a little bit uncomfortable when you're going from one state to the other. That's fine. That's just what life is. This is literally part of the definition of life. So that's Ann Laur leconf. She is a neuroscientist, former Google executive, and author of the wonderful book Tiny Experiments, which is sort of the neuroscientist guide to navigating this feeling of uncertainty that a lot of us have about whether we're really making the right choices in life. And by the way, if we haven't met, hello, my name is Ali. I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur and author of the New York Times bestseller Feel Good Productivity, which is about how to be more productive in a way that feels good. These days, my main gig is that my wife and I, along with our team, are building a series of productivity apps that we wish existed in the world and on the side. Since 2017, I've been making videos on this channel that are all about the books, strategies, and tools that we can use to help build a life that we love. So if that sounds like fun, then you might consider subscribing strategy number one, Recognize the Red Queen effect. So the red Queen effect comes from a quote from Alice in Wonderland where she's speaking to the red Queen and the red Queen Basically says you have to run really, really fast to keep in the same place. And if you want to get anywhere in life, you have to run twice as fast as you're physically capable of doing. And so the Red Queen effect is this feeling that we have in modern life where we have to keep on running faster and faster on the treadmill of life, but somehow we still feel like we are falling behind. We're working longer hours, we are optimizing the shit out of our morning routines, we are hustling on our side projects and our personal brands. And we are doing all this while we are scrolling the high like reels of other people's lives who seem to be further ahead than we are. And this never ending race, this hamster wheeling that we're all doing is the perfect setup for what neuroscientists like and law call time anxiety. Time anxiety is this belief, this sensation that you have that you're late in life, that you haven't done enough yet, that your peers are doing better, faster, and living more interesting lives. When I first read about time anxiety in the book, I was like, yes, this is it. This is the name of that feeling that I've had at various points throughout my life. When I was in high school and applying to medical school. Like, it was this feeling that other people out there had done more work experience, had better grades, had more things on their cv. When I was in medical school and trying to become a doctor, it was this feeling that, like, you know, other people are able to get ahead in their studies and they're also really popular and they're also doing the sports and they're also getting these publications and extra CV points. And now in my life as an entrepreneur and author, it's like, oh man, I should be doing more book promotion because these other authors are selling more books and now we're building all these apps, but like, they're not growing fast enough. Like we could grow them faster if we just did more things. It's this time anxiety thing that, like, time is running out and I am not moving fast enough. It really stems from social comparison because we all have this giant leaderboard that we're all looking at where we see that our friend or our colleague or this person we used to know is already there in their career or has this salary or is married with two kids already. And we haven't done these things yet. We keep on comparing our timelines and this is what creates the time anxiety. So people probably would have had time anxiety back in the day, but back in the day, the only people you could feasibly compare yourself to were other people who were around you. Whereas now, in the realm of social media, with YouTube and Instagram, TikTok, obviously all of the stuff, we're no longer just comparing our lives to the people around us. We are comparing our lives to literally everyone else in the world. And because of the way the algorithms are set up, we are very unlikely to come across an Instagram reel from someone who's leading a totally normal life. Instead, we're going to come across these Instagram reels of these people who are like, I don't know, building custom furniture for their kids or growing a $100 million business to a billion dollars in revenue and valuation. And so whatever game you are playing in your life, there are always people who are further ahead of that game that you're going to encounter on the social media feeds. And with this sort of thing, there really is no finishing line. It's a constant game of comparison. The whole Keeping up with the Joneses thing just supercharged in the realm of social media. So, firstly, it's to recognize that literally everyone has this feeling. I have spoken to people who are billionaires who have the feeling that, like, they're not working hard enough because their neighbor has more billions in the bank than they do. And the second thing to recognize is that you can never really win this game if you're playing the game in the first place. So the question is not how do I catch up and how do I feel less behind? It's why am I feeling as if I'm in this race in the first place? And there is a really good prompt, which is, what would your life look like if you didn't feel like you were in such a rush? What would change about how you're leading your life? What would change about how you're doing your work, running your business? What would change if you didn't feel like you were in such a rush? And this is something that every time I think about it, it just like, I'm just like, ah, just give me a feeling of liberation. I don't need to be in a rush. We do not need to be rushing. We don't need to have this feeling that we are behind on the milestones. Oh, by the way, if you are enjoying this video and you're in the majority of my audience who either are a creator or would like to be a creator someday, then you might like to check out Spotter Studio, who are very kind sponsoring today's video. Now, I wanted to show you a little bit of a behind the scenes look at how I come up with ideas for my videos. Because coming up with fresh and hopefully non repetitive content ideas week after week is honestly one of the hardest parts about being a creator. And that's why my team and I have been using Spotter Studio, which is an incredible AI powered platform specifically designed for creators like us. And it's basically changed our entire ideation process for making videos. So what you can do is whenever you're creating a new video, you can create a new project, you can put in the title and thumbnail that you're thinking about for the project, and then you can brainstorm, which is super nice. And I quite like Explode, which then uses the AI to kind of take the idea that you've come up with and give you a bunch of different options that could work for an alternative framing of that particular video. And you can see, for example, which specific words are outperforming in different niches. Like Storm apparently does really well in titles. World apparently does really well in titles. And so I can find something I like to look off, like your guide when feeling lost. And then you can kind of go through and shortlist your titles. There's also a very helpful outliers tool here which kind of figures out what the niche of your YouTube channel is, and then looks for other videos that are overperforming from other channels within a similar niche. And this is the sort of thing that used to be really manual and kind of time consuming back in the day, but now Spotter makes it really easy with this outlier analysis. And then if there's a video that you like the look of, you can use the Brainstorm feature, which then helps you take that general concept and do it in your own way. Spotter Studio has saved me and my team so much time on ideation and research, which means I can focus on the thing that I actually enjoy, which is like creating the content rather than worrying about how to package the content. And so if you're a creator who wants to take a more data driven approach to your content strategy, then check out Spotter Studio using the link in the video description. And they're constantly adding new features and tools to help creators like us hopefully make more useful videos for our audience. So thank you so much, Spotter Studio for sponsoring this video. Now, a big part of why we feel as if we are behind in these specific markets milestones. That leads us to strategy number two, which is to identify your invisible scripts. So cognitive scripts are little patterns, little Stories that we have stored in our brains and that help us navigate our lives and the world in the most efficient way possible. And those scripts tell you how you're supposed to behave and in what order, in what situation. So to give you an example, let's say you go to the dentist and they ask you to open your mouth right in the waiting room in front of everybody. You'd be like, what? I thought I was supposed to. Right? And that's a cognitive script. Everybody has it. We all know that. You go there, you wait in the waiting room, they're going to call your name, and then you go in the doctor's office, and then you open your mouth. So this idea of cognitive scripts was first identified by Roger Shank and Robert Abelson, who were scientists back in the 1970s. And the thing is, these cognitive scripts can be really useful. And they're useful because they're mental shortcuts that we can take so that we don't need to figure out how to order coffee every time we order coffee, or figure out how to cross the road from scratch every time we're trying to cross the road. But with all the time and brain space that these cognitive scripts save, there is also a darker side to these cognitive scripts, because they can basically hijack the most important decisions of our lives, like what we do for school or career or relationships without us even realizing it, because we have inadvertently, subconsciously taken that mental shortcut, and we end up living our life according to someone else's screenplay. Now, in the book, an lore talks about three specific cognitive scripts that keep us feeling lost and uncertain about where we're going. Firstly, we have the sequel script. This is when we feel like we need to make decisions today based on what we did yesterday. So, for example, when you finish university, you might only consider the types of jobs that are aligned with the studies that you did. Something that makes sense, that will make for a clean cv, a nice story. Nobody's going to be confused. It's just that movie. But again, the sequel. If you work in management consulting, for example, there are a few pretty obvious sequels you could do, like private equity, investment banking, do an mba. And so there's this profound, like, subconscious pressure to do the next thing that makes sense based on than whatever the previous thing was. And then we have popular script number two, which is the crowd pleaser script. The crowd pleaser is when you use a script that you know is going to make everybody around you happy. Nobody's going to be disappointed, especially not your parents. So in this one you might go for a career that you're not that excited about, but that, you know everybody's going to be happy about. This is naturally where we prioritize external validation sometimes without even realizing it. And that's why we feel. Sometimes we're like, you know, I'm doing this thing to please my parents or because society told me to, whatever society means anyway. And, like, I don't feel like it's quite the right thing. And then we have the third one that personally hit me the hardest, which is the epic script. It's the idea that if you're going to do something with your life, it better be big, it better be a Hollywood movie. And because of that, we make ourselves miserable trying to find our passion, to find our purpose. If we can't find it, if we feel a bit lost, if we're still searching for what is that thing that makes us want to wake up in the morning, we feel like we're a failure. This is the one I've been grappling with for the last few months where it feels like, okay, I mean, I've done the YouTube thing and I've wrote my book. It got onto the bestseller list. Like, what's the next even bigger thing? It feels pretty weird to be saying, like, you know what? I'm pretty content where I am. You know, I've just gotten married. I've got a kid on the way. I just want to chill out and spend time with the family. Like, that's kind of what I want to do. But it's also like, I kind of want to do these other things. I'm like, this build the software stuff, and I feel this pressure that, like, the next thing has to be even bigger than the last thing, because, like, you know, it's kind of lame if I'm just making productivity content for the rest of my life. Right? And so what I found really helpful from reading the book and from having the conversation with Ann Lore is to just. Just have the terminology for this to recognize. Oh, yeah. That's why I feel pulled towards this thing. It's because there is this subconscious script that's playing out in my mind that the next thing I do must be, by definition, bigger than the last thing that I did, even if that's running the risk of me making decisions that aren't actually aligned with my. My own authentic values. But then this feeling of uncertainty, this feeling of, like, what am I even. Am I going there? Or am I going there? I'm going there. I've got all these different Options. This feeling of uncertainty. Embracing this feeling of uncertainty leads us to strategy number three that I found incredibly helpful. By the way, if you're looking for some introspective exercises to help you navigate these cognitive scripts, I have created a completely free resource, the Journaling Hub, which is a completely free, constantly evolving document where I store my favorite journaling prompts for introspection about these big questions about what we should do with our lives. If you like that sort of thing and you want to try out some of these questions, there is a link down below. It's completely free. So strategy number three is to embrace liminal spaces. Now, if there was only one thing that I was allowed to take away from this book, it would be this terminology, this idea of a liminal space. A liminal space is an in between. It's a time in your life where you're not quite sure what you should be doing next, where there are no clear rules, where there's no definition of success that you can follow, no recipe that you can apply. And the automatic reaction that we have when we find ourselves in the liminal spaces to try and cross it as quickly as possible. Get back on shore, get back to safety. So the word liminal comes from the Latin limen, meaning threshold. The idea is that you are standing at this threshold, this doorway, between who you were and who you are becoming. You're not quite there, but you're also not quite here. You're in this sort of in between space. Now, these liminal spaces are everywhere in our lives. We can have physical liminal spaces, like being in an airport or being in a lift or being in a waiting room. These places aren't destinations in and of themselves. They tend to be transitional places between other places. You can have physiological liminal spaces, like going through puberty, where you're sort of neither here nor there, or as my wife tells me, the process of becoming a mother. Whereas it's sort of like you're in this in between space between not being a mum and being a mum. But then there's the third category of liminal spaces that a lot of us might have found ourselves in, which is emotional liminal spaces, like where you finish university before you have landed your first job and you have this like weird gap. And whenever we are in these liminal spaces, it is totally normal for that uncertainty of the space to feel really uncomfortable. You don't know what your role is. You don't know where you're going, you don't know who else is in that space. You don't know how big the space is, then it's really scary. Your brain is looking at this and feeling like we have zero information. Let's get out of here. So from an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense. Like uncertainty used to equal danger. If you didn't know where your next meal was coming from, then that was a legitimate survival threat. And so our brain evolved over like 300,000 years to develop mechanisms that reduce the amount of uncertainty in our lives and help us feel comfortable with certainty. But then the problem that we have is that this survival mechanism can completely backfire in our modern lives. And so whenever we are in one of these liminal, uncomfortable, uncertain spaces, like this threshold between two things, the in between space where you just quit your job and you're not sure what the next thing is, the primitive regions of the brain are so wired to, like, rush to something certain as soon as possible so that we can feel safe. But the key thing Ann Lore talks about in her book and that we talked about in the conversation as well, is that rather than trying to escape a liminal space, we should instead try to embrace it. Good way to think about liminal spaces is to picture yourself on a plane where you're going somewhere. So there are two ways that you could react if you find yourself on a plane. The first one is to start panicking because you're not the one in the pilot seat. You have zero control, and you're in this tin can that is flying super quickly in the sky, right? But there's another way you can consider this experience. This is an amazing opportunity to have time for yourself. Completely disconnected from the world. No wi fi, nobody can reach you, and you can finally read that book that you've been wanting to read for a long time. You can journal, you can even watch that kind of silly movie that your friends would be a little bit surprised to see you watch. And this is basically the two reactions that you can have in the liminal space. Having this conversation with an Laura was genuinely transformative to me. Like, we had the conversation a couple of months ago and at the time I was in the throes of like, oh, like, do I, do I go here with the software stuff or do it like, right, another book? Or do I do this YouTube thing, or do I like to try and do something even bigger? And reading the book and the conversation made me realize that, ah, I am in a liminal space. It is normal for a liminal space to feel uncomfortable and it is normal for me to feel like, oh, I'm not Doing the right thing by trying to get to certainty as soon as possible. And so the main thing that I really took away is that in those moments, rather than trying to rush to make a decision, it's actually totally okay to stay with that uncertainty, to get comfortable with that feeling of uncertainty, and to recognize that actually a lot of personal growth and a lot of figuring out what we truly authentically want comes from being in those liminal spaces rather than being outside of them. All right, so what do we do when we're in one of these liminal spaces? Well, that's where strategy four comes in, which is to escape the tyranny of purpose. Now, there is a cool graph that Andor shows in her book, which is if you look at, like, how often in books the phrase find your purpose was mentioned, this is what the graph looks like. Like, in the last 200 years, no one really cared that much about finding their purpose. But in the last 20 years, suddenly everyone is all about trying to find their big P purpose. And the key argument that an Lore makes in the book really is that this idea of finding your purpose came about as a way to reject the rigid traditional career path. Like, most of us are probably not going to be in exactly the same career for 50 years like our parents maybe were. And so we replaced that rigid traditional thinking with this idea of we've got to find our purpose. But what and Law argues is that actually this find my one true purpose is equally restrictive as a traditional career once was. Like, we thought that we were choosing freedom. Like, oh, I can do whatever I want. I can find my purpose. But actually, what she argues is that we have just swapped one cognitive script for another. I found myself really resonating with this when we were having that conversation. I feel this pressure in my own life. There's this constant feeling to identify that one thing that I'm supposedly supposed to do for the rest of my life. There are books that talk about this. There's the One Thing by Gary Kaller. There's essentialism by Greg McKeown. And I really like a lot of these books. And a lot of the message behind them is that, hey, if you can find that one true thing, then that's the thing that will get you out of bed in the morning and help you feel motivated when motivation inevitably dips. And this feeling of, like, if I haven't yet found that one true thing, then this, you know, I'm doing. I'm doing something wrong. But the problem with this sort of thinking is that we have turned Purpose into a destination, which is a fixed endpoint that we need to reach, after which everything will magically make sense. But this is another classic example of the arrival fallacy. That's like a thing in psychology that once we arrive at a particular destination, then we will be happy. Once I've gotten that promotion, once I find my purpose, then I will no longer struggle with what the point is. But the truth is, purpose is something that you live every day that changes, that evolves with you because you change as a person. And so instead of chasing it as almost as this destination that you need to reach. Ha. I found my purpose. I'm good. I won. It should really be something that you live with, like a question that you have and that you keep on exploring for the entirety of your life. And this was genuinely one of the most liberating ideas that I got from the conversation and from the book, which is that what if purpose is not something that you are looking for, like this. This treasure that you find once and for all and that you never have to think about it ever again? What if purpose is instead this thing that we are continuously discovering and rediscovering as we go along? So if you're at this point in the video and maybe you're feeling a little lost because you haven't found your one true purpose or your one true calling, then maybe you're not the problem. Maybe it's just this definition that we have somehow psyoped ourselves into believing that this purpose has to be the singular, unchanging, like, unifying thing that will give everything in your life meaning. And so instead of asking something really big like, what is my life's purpose? What would happen if instead tried to ask ourself a question like, what gives my life meaning right now in this season of life? And I really like this idea of, like, seasonality in this current season of life. For me, what gives my life meaning on the work front is continuing to make YouTube videos that I think are helpful and building cool productivity apps that I want to use every day and that hopefully millions of people can use. But a few months from now, when I become a dad, then maybe the purpose thing will change and maybe my whole shtick will be like, oh, my goodness, the thing that gives my life meaning and purpose right now is spending time with my wife and daughter. I don't know what's going to happen. But the fact that I don't know, and I'm now having read this book and had the conversation, I'm now okay with not really Knowing what the future could look like in terms of purpose, that just gives me an enormous feeling of like, liberation and freedom and like, ah, I don't need to worry so much about this. And so finally we come to strategy number five, which is to run tiny experiments. And that is why the title of the book is Tiny how to Live Freely in a Goal Obsessed World. And the idea here is that if we are in one of these liminal spaces where we feel a little bit lost, we might find it helpful to shift away from thinking about linear goals to instead thinking about experimental goals. A linear goal is a goal that has a very clear milestone and it's a binary definition of success. So either you make it to med school or you don't. Either you get the job or you don't get the job. Either your startup is a success or it's a failure. It's very, very binary. Obviously the problem with linear goals is that they're kind of all or nothing. You've either succeeded at the goal or you have failed at the goal. And they put a lot of pressure on us. Now, I think linear goals are totally fine in a lot of different circumstances. Like right now I have a linear goal to grow our various productivity apps. But that's because I know that for me, in the season of life, right now, building these productivity apps is a thing that I'm actively working towards. It's a thing that I'm doing with my wife. We've formed a little bit of a family business around it. We're working with our friends, we're working with our team. It's like a fun thing that we're doing. And so within that specific context, setting linear goals makes sense. But in a domain where you're feeling a little bit lost, where you're not sure if whatever you're pursuing is the right thing to do, linear goals make a lot less sense. And the alternative is experimental goals. So if you design a goal that's experimental rather than linear, you're starting from a hypothesis. This instead of saying, let's go there and if we don't get there, we failed. You say, okay, what if we tried this? And you then design an experiment where you're going to collect data. So you say that for a certain period of time you're going to perform that action that could be publishing a certain number of YouTube videos or that could be writing a newsletter that could be even for personal stuff, your health, meditation, going to bed at the same time. And you're not saying we're going to do that we're committing to this, this is going to be a habit, or that's the big goal for the next year. You're saying this is an experiment. Whatever happens, this is data. There's no failure when the only objective is to see what happens. If it works great, you can keep going or you can even scale up. If it doesn't, you've learned something and you can use that information to inform your next experiment. If you are in that moment of feeling like, oh, I haven't yet figured out what that path is, or like what my career is right now, instead of thinking, I need to do a big thing to make this happen, instead we want to think, okay, what is a tiny experiment that I might run that can just give me some more data? And Anlore talks about how you can structure these tiny experiments as pacts. Pacts. Now, pact. PACT stands for purposeful. So this thing should feel exciting and meaningful to you. Actionable, something actually concrete that you can do continuous. It's simple enough to repeat regularly for the duration of your experiment and trackable with a clear yes or no answer to did I actually do the thing? Like in my case back when I was a doctor and I was unsure of like, do I quit medicine to do this YouTube thing or do I like kind of do both at the same time? My hypothesis was, okay, I'm gonna try part time medicine and see what it feels like. So I was like, all right, cool, for the next few weeks, I'm gonna do two shifts every week at the hospital and see how I feel about it. And I ran the experiment. I realized, hmm, I don't even enjoy particularly doing those two shifts when the alternative is I can work on my business, my books, my YouTube channel. And so that was a tiny experiment that I ran that gave me permission to just gather more data about what, what personally felt meaningful to me. And so really the whole idea of creating tiny experiments is that we are reducing the pressure on us. We don't have to find the right thing immediately. You can just run a bunch of different tiny experiments. And she's got a bunch of like, strategies in the book that are really good that talk about more details about how to specifically carve out a tiny experiment in your life or multiple experiments based on what you want. And the more of this data that you gather about yourself through these tiny experiments, this becomes like a process of self discovery where slowly you get all this data and you realize, okay, this is the sort of direction that I seem to be enjoying taking my life. And so when you're in one of these liminal spaces where you feel lost. You're not, like, wholesale trying to commit to a new path straight away. You're staying in that liminal space. You're embracing this feeling of discomfort. You're running tiny experiments from this feeling of discomfort. And as you gather more data, you'll move to a new phase of your life where you won't be in so much of a liminal space. And then the thing will happen again, because after a few years, you might realize, you know what, this new career that I'm in, I'm in a different season of life, and I want something different. And now you're back to the liminal space again, where you've got to embrace the discomfort, embrace the uncertainty, and again run some tiny experiments from that place of discovery. Now, if you enjoyed this video, I think you'll get a lot of value from this very short playlist of three videos that I created last year, which are my favorite journaling prompts and methods for introspecting and helping you figure out what you really want if you're in one of these liminal spaces. So check that out over there. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.","80-273270: Time anxiety is a feeling that you're late in life

**Chapter Summaries**  

**[00:00-04:33] Time anxiety is a feeling that you're late in life**  
Ali introduces ""time anxiety""—the belief that others are ahead in life milestones (career, relationships, etc.) due to social comparison amplified by social media. He shares personal examples, explaining how algorithms highlight extreme success stories, creating an unwinnable race. Recognizing this universal struggle and questioning why we feel rushed (e.g., ""What would change if I weren’t in a rush?"") can alleviate pressure.  

**[04:33-05:07] What would your life look like if you weren't in such a rush**  
This short chapter transitions into a sponsored segment, prompting viewers to reflect on how rushing shapes their decisions. Ali hints at liberation from societal timelines before introducing Spotter Studio.  

**[05:07-06:39] Spotter Studio is an AI powered platform specifically designed for creators like us**  
Ali demonstrates Spotter Studio, an AI tool for content creators. It aids in brainstorming video ideas, analyzing trends, and optimizing titles/thumbnails using data-driven insights. The platform streamlines ideation, allowing creators to focus on content production. He highlights features like ""Explode"" (generating alternative video framings) and ""Outliers"" (identifying niche-specific overperforming content).  

**[06:39-08:00] Cognitive scripts are little patterns that help us navigate the world efficiently**  
Cognitive scripts—mental shortcuts for routine tasks—can become harmful when applied to major life decisions. Ali explains three problematic scripts: the *Sequel* (choosing paths based on past choices), *Crowd-Pleaser* (prioritizing external validation), and *Epic* (demanding grandiose achievements). These scripts trap people in unfulfilling paths by subconsciously adhering to societal or familial expectations.  

**[08:00-10:58] Three cognitive scripts keep us feeling lost and uncertain about where we're going**  
Expanding on cognitive scripts, Ali shares personal struggles with the *Epic Script* (pressure to outdo past achievements) and how labeling these patterns helps disrupt them. He introduces the concept of *liminal spaces* (threshold periods of uncertainty) as a segue to strategy three.  

**[10:58-14:48] So strategy number three is to embrace liminal spaces**  
Liminal spaces—transitions like career shifts or parenthood—trigger discomfort due to evolutionary aversion to uncertainty. Ali compares them to air travel: resisting vs. embracing the ""in-between"" (e.g., using the time for reflection). He advocates staying in liminality to foster growth, sharing how accepting his own uncertainty (e.g., balancing entrepreneurship and family) reduced anxiety.  

**[14:48-18:06] The idea of finding your purpose came about as a way to reject traditional career paths**  
The modern obsession with ""purpose"" replaced rigid career paths but created new pressure. Ali critiques treating purpose as a fixed destination, citing the *arrival fallacy* (expecting happiness post-achievement). Instead, he frames purpose as evolving with life seasons (e.g., work focus pre-parenthood vs. family focus later). Asking ""What gives me meaning *now*?"" reduces existential pressure.  

**[18:06-22:25] A linear goal is a goal that has a very clear milestone**  
Linear goals (binary success/failure) work in stable phases but exacerbate uncertainty. Ali contrasts them with *experimental goals*—small, hypothesis-driven actions (e.g., testing part-time work) that gather data without pressure. Using the PACT framework (Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, Trackable), he shares how experimenting with medical shifts clarified his career shift. Tiny experiments normalize exploration, making liminal spaces productive.  

---  

**Key Points:**  
- Time anxiety stems from social comparison, worsened by algorithms showcasing extreme success.  
- Cognitive scripts (Sequel, Crowd-Pleaser, Epic) hijack authentic decision-making through subconscious societal norms.  
- Liminal spaces (transitions) are growth opportunities when embraced, not rushed.  
- Purpose is dynamic, not a fixed destination; redefine it by season, not lifetime.  
- Replace linear goals with tiny experiments to reduce pressure and gather self-discovery data.  

**Tags:** time anxiety, cognitive scripts, liminal spaces, purpose, productivity  

**Insight/Outlook:**  
Embracing uncertainty as a natural, transformative phase—rather than a problem to solve—can shift personal growth from a stressful race to a curious, iterative journey."
audio_17.mp3,"Hey, friends. Welcome back to the channel. In this video, I would like to talk about why you should consider starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. And if you happen to be new here. Hello, my name is Ali. I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur and author, and I've been making YouTube videos on this channel since 2017, talking about the strategies, the books, the ideas, the tools that can help us build a life we love. And for me, the decision that I personally took many years ago to start a YouTube channel was the single most life changing decision of my entire life. I started out in 2016 making random crappy YouTube music videos that no one watched. But through that process, I learned a little bit about what it takes to, to actually make a YouTube video. And then in 2017, when I saw a business opportunity, I was like, oh, I could make videos talking about helping people get into med school. And this could be interesting because it could drive sales to my course. That was when I really started taking YouTube seriously. And now I've been doing it consistently. Pretty much every good thing that's happened in my life since 2017, I can like directly boil down to my YouTube channel in one degree or another. And so in this video, I would like to share my top reasons as to why you should potentially consider starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. There are all sorts of reasons I could tell you. I could talk about all of the practical benefits. I could talk about the value of being able to speak on camera, which for the rest I think is very valuable. I could talk about the value of learning how to edit videos, which even though AI tools are increasingly going to be taking over video editing, if you have the skill yourself, you can then prompt AI tools or use them better. I could make the case that, hey, if you start a YouTube channel at the start, maybe no one watches, but if you stay consistent with it over time, maybe you'll grow, maybe you'll get famous, maybe you'll get rich and all that kind of stuff. But none of that is really the key point. The key reason, the one that trumps everything else, is because of the internal growth, the personal and emotional and spiritual growth you will go through as a result of starting a YouTube channel, even if no one watches. The thing is, starting a YouTube channel, what it really does on an internal level, is that you are taking your ego and you are putting it out outside of your body into the world where it could be attacked. And that is scary. Maybe scary isn't the word that comes to mind for you, but there's often interesting emotions that come up when we have the audacity to speak to a camera and stick that video on the Internet. There are emotions that come up when you simply just hit record on the camera with the intent to put it on the Internet. I could ask you right now, get out your phone and make your first YouTube video and just hit record on your phone, boom. And some emotions will come up. It's not the same as being on a zoom call. Like on a zoom call, someone asks you a question, you can just respond. If you're having a conversation in real life, someone asks you a question, you can just respond. But there's something about the format of speaking to a camera, knowing that it might get published, that feels confronting in some kind of way. And that is a very good thing. The whole thing around, like personal, emotional, spiritual growth involves putting ourselves into uncomfortable situations where we are able to confront the internal demons that guard the gates, as it were. When you have the audacity to start a YouTube channel even though no one is watching and you put your ego out there, you'll feel the fear, you'll feel that, you'll feel the judgment, you'll feel the fear of judgment. You'll be thinking, damn, why does my face look so weird? I couldn't have any of my friends possibly seeing this video because that would be embarrassing. What about my work colleagues? You know, I'm considered a reasonably competent person at work. But then if people see this shitty video of mine that's like out there on the Internet, like, oh my God, like all of these things is a function of taking our ego, putting it out there in a basic ass form like making a friggin YouTube video and sticking on the Internet. And it's so valuable, it's so valuable to confront those feelings. It's so valuable to understand that they exist and to try and figure out where they're coming from and try and do something about them. Because really a huge part of like personal and emotional and spiritual growth is recognizing that A, no one actually cares. B if they do, it shouldn't really affect you. C, how the hell do you not care about what other people around you think? How do you like do your own thing? And basically what all of personal and spiritual growth eventually ends up in is being a being able to transcend the ego, being able to do something without the fear of this shell of an identity that we've crafted around ourselves being battered proverbially because someone on the Internet left a comment saying that your nose is too big or that you've got a zit on there or like, or you know, I don't like your accent or you speak too fast or like you're ugly or like oh my God. Like We've had various people take my course, the part time YouTuber Academy link down below if you want to check it out. We've had several thousand people take that course and lots of them have made only a handful of videos. And one thing a lot of people say is that even though they didn't make it as a YouTuber, which was probably normally the initial goal when they start something like this, even though they didn't make it as a YouTuber, they are still really glad about the growth that they had on that journey of even just making a few videos. And by the way, if you do happen to start a YouTube channel and you are interested in some six background music for your videos, then you'll want to check out Epidemic Sound who are very kindly sponsoring this video. I've been using Epidemic Sound for every single one of my YouTube videos since 2017, since I first started taking videos seriously. I started using Epidemic because they were recommended by Peter McKinnon, who was a big inspiration behind the channel and still is. Epidemic Sound has a massive library of over 50,000 songs and 200,000 sound effects, and all of these are restriction free, so you can use them across any of your projects, including YouTube videos, without any copyright issues. But today I want to talk about something really exciting that they've just launched called Voices, which is going to be super interesting for anyone creating content, including you. So with Voices by Epidemic Sound, you can easily craft the perfect voiceover for your content using professional voice artists. You can also create the perfect voiceover using your own voice, so no rerecording necessary. And this is perfect for your narration or podcasts or ad reads or adding segments to your video if you don't want it to be your voice on certain segments of the video. For artistic reasons, you can even modify the speed of the voiceover to match your storytelling needs and to help your content stay consistent. Even if you don't want to rerecord stuff, there's no need to rerecord, which is a key benefit related to the capability of recording and using your own voice. Voices is powered by AI, so you can fine tune the pacing and the language to match any style, which gives you full creative control. The best part is that Voices is already included in your subscription for both trial and paying commercial plan users with a set of credits provided each month. It's available both online and seamlessly within the Epidemic Sound plugins for Adobe and DaVinci Resolve. So it fits right into your workflow on demand, anytime, anywhere. So if you want to bring your videos to life with professional sound and now professional voiceovers, check out Epidemic Sound sound using the link below. And when you sign up for a free trial, you will get access to everything, including the new Voices feature. So thank you so much, Epidemic Sound for being our source of background music for the last eight years and also for sponsoring this video. And let's get back to it. So one aspect of this is this whole, like, internal confronting of the ego, where you try and stop caring about what other people think. Another big part of it is that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, especially if you've never done this sort of video thing before, helps you feel more of a sense of personal agency. It helps you get more of that feeling of you can actually take something random, like the art of making videos, and you can figure it out. To quote the title of Marie Folio's wonderful book, Everything is Figureoutable. And the thing is, when we start off as kids, we all have this belief that everything is figureoutable. Like, kids don't usually have fear. You'll see kids running around and, like, doing all the stuff and jumping off of things and et cetera, et cetera. But usually at some point as we grow older, we start to internalize the belief that we cannot figure out new things, we cannot learn new things. For some people, tragically, it happens in childhood where, like, a parent or a caregiver or a teacher tells you that you suck in there and you've internalized that for your whole life and then believe you can't do anything. This is how you end up with a fixed mindset rather than a growth mindset. For some people, that happens in school or in university or whatever when they realize that, like, oh, you know, a teacher said you're bad at math or bad at languages, and you start internalizing that thing. For a lot of us, it actually happens when we're doing our jobs because, you know, we got through school, got through university, started doing jobs, and then we became quite specialized at doing the thing. And we never really tried to branch out of the thing. Main thing that we're doing for work because, like, life gets in the way and stuff. And so when it comes to thinking like, oh, let me start a new hobby, like learning the guitar, every year, all these people decide they want to take up a musical instrument almost no one sticks through with it because they don't enjoy the experience of being really, really, really bad at something. Your ego starts to feel a bit threatened that, like, no, we're so competent in our job as an accountant, and so we don't want to suck at playing the guitar. We don't want to suck on this YouTube thing. We don't. We don't want to be bad at anything. And you can't learn new things without being okay with being bad at doing the thing initially. So why should you start a YouTube channel even if no one watches? It's because you will learn interesting skills in the process of that. But what is arguably even more important than the skills that you learn is the meta skill that you learn, which is the ability to learn new things. I remember back when I used to be a doctor working in the UK's National Health Service, and after about two years in my local hospital where I was working, a lot of the senior doctors knew that I had this YouTube channel and I had this business. And then, I think around then was when I made a video talking about how much money I made as a doctor versus a YouTuber. And then that video seemed to go around. So then, like, I kind of became known as, you know, this. This random, like, junior doctor who's like 26, who walks around in blue scrubs with bright orange trainers and whatever, this guy is making bank on the Internet. And I had a lot of senior doctors come up to me, really, like, encouraging me to do the thing. And it would emerge from pretty much all of these conversations that a lot of these senior doctors, they felt like they couldn't learn new things. They felt like they were so specialized within medicine that had all this sunk cost of medical school and then, like, years, if not decades worth of training that even though their heart might not necessarily have been in the thing, what they said was, yeah, but I don't think I could do anything else. I'm not saying that if you're a doctor in your 40s or 50s, suddenly starting a YouTube channel is going to be the answer to all of your dreams and hopes and aspirations. Not what I'm saying at all. What I'm saying is that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, with whatever kind of professional background you have, will force you to learn new skills and will therefore teach your brain and your heart and your soul that you are someone who can learn new things. With our YouTuber Academy, for example, the average age of Our student is 36. We had a guy take the Course, his name is Azul. He's like in his 50s as like a financial planner for old people, basically. And he decided, you know what? I'm going to reinvent myself. I'm going to try something new. And he started making YouTube videos where he just walks around with his phone, talking to the phone and giving financial advice to old people. And his channel blew up after about 18 months of doing it. Initially, he didn't get any traction at all, but he kept on doing. He kept on making one or two videos a week, even switched to daily uploads at one point, because he realized he enjoyed the process and he enjoyed the process of learning the new skills along the way at whatever stage of life you're at. I personally feel that starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, just will be a valuable use of your time. I'm not saying you have to make 100 videos. I'm not saying you have to make one video a week. I'm not saying that the goal is to become rich or to become famous or anything like that. What I'm saying is that just give it a go. If you're watching the video at this point, you know, chances are if you've never thought about starting a YouTube channel, you probably didn't even click on this video. It's not even relevant to you. But if you're watching the video at this point, I would ask you, what is holding you back? What I hope that this video can be for a handful of people, maybe ideally even more than a handful of people, is the nudge that you need the permission that you've been waiting for from someone else who allegedly seems to know what they're talking about because they've got like millions of subscribers or whatever. The nudge you've been waiting for to actually just make a bet on yourself, to trust that you can learn new things and you can give this a go, even if it goes nowhere, even if no one watches the stuff. You will still, I promise you will still learn valuable skills. You will still find it a useful activity to do for the emotional growth, the internal growth, the personal growth, the spiritual growth, for the meta growth of learning that you can learn new skills. Learning new things is a key part of how we keep our minds healthy. It's how we keep our spirit healthy. Because the spirit and soul, or whatever you want to call it, has these needs for, like, growth. And so starting a YouTube channel, even when no one is watching, is a really nice source of growth. And then at this point, people are like, okay, but like, what would I make videos about? You can make videos about whatever you want. We have this thing, our seven video challenge, if you're interested in joining it. It's for complete beginners where we basically give you prompts for your first seven videos. It'll be linked down below. Lots of people have taken it. The idea is that, you know, you pay to join the challenge, but if you make seven videos in seven months, we give you a whole seven months to make the seven videos. We will refund every penny you've paid. So basically it serves as an accountability mechanism which gives you a few easy prompts that you can make videos about. But even if you don't want to take the challenge, what's a video you can make? Well, a video you can make is why I started a YouTube channel at the age of X or whatever. Why I started a YouTube channel as an accountant, why I started even just why I started a YouTube channel. Another video you could make. Five lessons I learned in the last five years. Another thing you can make, advice I would give to my 21 year old self. Depending on how old you are, obviously if you, you know, whatever. In fact, if you do decide to make that video, I would love it if you can link it down below in the comments. Because I would love to have a look at some of these and see what the vibe is. But we don't want to be overthinking the stuff. We don't want to be trying to approach it like a, you know, a business planner being like, okay, my goal is to get a million subscribers. You know, the goal is simply to try it out. The goal is to do the thing. Starting a YouTube channel for a lot of people is a means to an end. It's like, hey, if I make YouTube videos, then I'll get subscribers and sponsors and money and I'll be able to live a life. It becomes like an instrumental goal, a means to an end for me. When I started YouTube, my first few videos I make, I think, I think were in like 2016. And I'm really glad it didn't start off as a money making scheme. Since 2010, I wanted to be a YouTuber because I wanted to make music videos. I loved people like Kurt Schneider and Sam Tuohy and still do. And I was like, I'm gonna make music videos with my friends because my friends are good at singing and I can, I can learn how to play musical instruments because that'll be fun. And I'd learn new skills and stuff and like, this would be Cool. And so for 76 years, I procrastinated every summer holiday. I was like, I was saying to my friend Dranka, right, this is the summer we're gonna make that music video. Finally. You know, it's gonna happen, we're gonna do it. And in 2016, I decided to make some of these music videos. They are still active on the channel. The goal was never to try and get rich or famous. It was just like it would be cool to be a YouTuber. And then I made a handful of these music videos. And then I realized no one watches, but I learned the skills of how to make videos. I learned how to use a camera and I learned how to edit. Then mid 2017, when I have the idea that like I can use YouTube as a lead generation device for my business that was helping kids, kids get into med school, suddenly I was like, oh, I already know how to make videos because I dabbled with these shitty music videos back in the day. So why don't I use the skills that I learned in making videos and now apply it to this business opportunity? I did not start off thinking that there was a business opportunity at the time. There was none of this content out there about how to make it on YouTube, how to make money, etc, etc. I think one of the downsides of that content and I, I would blame myself partly in fairness, I do try and always say with any of my content for creators, don't try and make money from it, that that should not be the primary, the primary goal. There's all this stuff about how you can make Money as a YouTuber or as an influencer and stuff. And I think it gives people the wrong impression. It makes people think that the only reason to do it is for the money. But actually there are loads of people who like play the guitar for fun, who make YouTube videos for fun. Because the art of creative expression and creative pursuit and like putting yourself out there and like editing a thing, it's like, it's like an art project almost. What would it take for you to see it as a bit of a hobby, as a bit of an art project? And maybe if you find yourself enjoying it and you're like, you know what, I can see myself doing this for like 10 years and enjoying the process, then we can now start talking about like a business plan and the niche and like target audience and value proposition and all the stuff that we talk about in my course. But you don't need to start out like that. You don't need to start out with that sort of I'm approaching this like a businessman approach. In fact, I would recommend you not do that. I'd recommend that your first seven videos are purely for you. They're purely experimental to see if you like the art of making YouTube videos. It doesn't cost you anything to do those seven videos. You don't need gear. You can just use your phone. You probably have a phone. You have a device that you're watching this on. You can download Imovie for free. You can download DaVinci Resolve for free. Video editing software. You can download Capcut. I think it's free on your phone. It's like, you don't even need to edit the video. You could literally just film a video and upload it straight to YouTube, straight from the app. You don't even need to do long form video. You could even do YouTube shorts or Instagram Reels or TikTok. Just any of these social media type things that involve creating something, having the audacity to put yourself out there. Because like, creating a faceless video is like, it's fine, but it doesn't give you all the spiritual growth benefits that putting your face out there does, because that's really confronting. If you're like a random person who's never, ever, ever thought about starting a YouTube channel and you're still at this point in the video, what are you doing here? It's like, hopefully, maybe I've convinced you that would be interesting. But like, I'm hopefully speaking to you right now because you've been thinking about this and you haven't done it yet. And someone else, like, it's okay, just like, give it a go, treat it like a hobby. I treated it like a hobby initially. I had no idea that it could become like a multimillion dollar business many years down the line. And had I known that, had I known that the possibility was there, I might not even have started because I would have overthought even more than I already did for the six whole fricking years before I got started. I would have overthought it to the point that I wouldn't have ever taken action. So that is today's public service announcement. If you've been thinking of starting a YouTube channel, I would recommend you do it even if no one is watching. And I am rooting for you from afar, from here in Hong Kong. And I would love it if you can post a comment down below of like, you know, your link to your channel or link to your video or whatever. The thing is, if this video has inspired you to take any kind of action at all. And of course, if you would like to dive deeper on this stuff, feel free to check out my course, part time YouTuber Academy or our seven video challenge. If you're a complete beginner, those will be linked down below. And if you do in fact want a deeper dive on strategies for starting a YouTube channel, this is my ultimate beginner's guide to starting a YouTube channel that goes over my three level system. So you can check that out if you'd like. Anyway, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

The video advocates starting a YouTube channel even without an audience, emphasizing personal growth, skill development, and overcoming fear. Ali, a doctor-turned-YouTuber, shares his journey, highlighting how creating content fosters emotional resilience, reinforces the ability to learn new skills, and builds confidence. He argues that confronting ego, embracing discomfort, and treating YouTube as a creative hobby—rather than a monetization tool—lead to internal transformation and unexpected opportunities.  

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-00:49] Why you should consider starting a YouTube channel even if no one watches**  
Ali introduces himself as a former doctor turned full-time YouTuber and explains how starting his channel in 2017 transformed his life. He initially created low-effort music videos with no viewers but later pivoted to educational content, which became the foundation of his career. He stresses that the decision to start YouTube, despite initial failures, led to personal and professional growth, setting the stage for discussing its broader benefits.  

**[00:49-06:05] Top reasons why you should start a YouTube channel even if no one watches**  
Ali dismisses superficial reasons like fame or money, focusing instead on confronting fear and ego. Recording and publishing videos forces creators to face judgment, self-doubt, and vulnerability, which builds emotional resilience. He shares anecdotes from students in his course who gained confidence even without becoming full-time creators. A sponsored segment promotes Epidemic Sound’s new AI voiceover tool, Voices, as a resource for content creators.  

**[06:05-12:26] Starting a YouTube channel helps you feel more of a sense of personal agency**  
Creating content combats the ""fixed mindset"" by proving one can learn new skills (e.g., filming, editing). Ali argues that adults often avoid new challenges due to fear of incompetence, but YouTube forces them to embrace being a beginner. Examples include a 50-year-old financial planner who reinvented himself through YouTube. The process teaches the ""meta-skill"" of learning itself, fostering confidence and adaptability applicable beyond content creation.  

**[12:26-15:45] Kong: I started making YouTube videos because I thought it would be cool**  
Ali recounts his own origin story: he started YouTube in 2016 as a hobby to make music videos, not for profit. This experimentation gave him foundational skills he later leveraged for business. He advises treating early videos as low-stakes ""art projects"" and recommends free tools like CapCut or DaVinci Resolve. His ""7 Video Challenge"" encourages beginners to experiment without pressure, emphasizing enjoyment over monetization.  

Key Points:  
- Starting a YouTube channel builds emotional resilience by confronting fear of judgment and ego.  
- It fosters a growth mindset, proving adults can learn new skills and adapt beyond their comfort zones.  
- Treating content creation as a hobby (not a business) reduces pressure and encourages creativity.  
- Early experimentation with low-effort videos lays the groundwork for unexpected future opportunities.

Insight/Outlook: Prioritizing personal growth and creative expression over metrics or monetization can unlock unforeseen confidence, skills, and opportunities, making YouTube a tool for self-discovery rather than just a platform for fame."
audio_18.mp3,"Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. So I recently spoke to a neuroscientist about how to reduce your stress levels. So this is endorphins. With endorphins, I'm basically going to give you an entirely different perspective on how humans should be managing stress. And stress is a huge topic. It's part of being a human. It has benefits and it has challenges. Like stress can actually help us to advance as a human and hyper focus our brain when we're under stress. And also if it's too chronic, the stress can be challenging. Now chronic stress is a huge problem. Apparently around a third of adults in the US are overwhelmed by stress on most days, which is kind of a big deal. But TJ Power is a neuroscientist who runs the Dose Lab, which specializes in understanding the four main brain chemicals that influence our day to day lives. Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins. And very excitingly, we are exploring each one of these in this four part video series. And in this last video, we're going to be looking at how endorphins work to reduce our stress. And then we're going to be talking about five actionable things we can do to increase the release of endorphins within our own systems. Part 1 the law of endorphins so in northern Tanzania, the Hadza tribe are one of the last remaining groups of hunter gatherers on the planet. And researchers have done lots of studies to find out what their daily life actually looks like and how it affects their health. Now what's actually quite surprising from this study in 2020 is that the Hadza tribe spend around 10 hours every single day not doing any physical activity. And this time spent sedentary is similar to that found in industrialized populations. But the key difference is that sedentary time in hunter gatherers is often spent in postures like squatting that lead to higher levels of muscle activity than chair sit. So they're basically doing what we call active rest. And the researchers of the study came up with this idea of the inactivity mismatch hypothesis. As humans, we evolved to engage our muscles all throughout the day, through both walking and running, to hunt and gather food and these forms of active rest. But now when we are relaxing, either we are sitting at our desk or lying on a couch or on a bed, and all of our muscles are totally relaxed, and this is where it's not good for us. Being completely sedentary for long periods of time apparently increases our risk of death. And diseases like heart disease and cancer. And it can build up lots of stress inside the bodies as well, which just adds to all of the other stresses we have going on in our lives. Now, if we think about how we evolved, there were just two main forms of stress, Hunger and danger. When you then look at how we would respond to those two experiences, one thing is in common that we'd have to do, which is physically exert our body pretty hard in order to get out of the stressful state. So we would have to fight an animal, we'd have to run away from another human, we'd have to deeply try and pursue finding food. But the one thing in common is our body had to physically work pretty hard. And when you look into this effectively, when our body is extreme, experiencing extreme physical exertion, in order to help us cope with the experience of that stress, it begins to release endorphins, which will calm our brain down. Endorphins are essentially our body's feel good hormones. There's about 20 different types of them in total, and they are released from the brain when we feel pain or stress. This then does two things. So A, it helps us cope with the pain or stress, and B, they also weirdly improve our mood. Beta endorphin was the first one of these to be discovered, and it's often linked to the idea of runner's high, which is where apparently people who are into running feel really good after they've gone out for a run. I've tried this. I never feel good after a run, but apparently you have to do it for a while before you start, like, really experiencing the endorphin release. And what's cool is that it turns out that beta endorphin is actually a much stronger pain reliever than morphine. And as you might know, one of the best ways to trigger the release of endorphins in general is to physically exert our bodies. And all of that gets us to the fundamental law of endorphins, which is move your body every day. Part two, five actions to increase endorphins. Action number one, walk runs. The law of endorphins is physically push your body every day. And this is interesting because, like, there's different approaches to, like, how much movement should we get, how many gym workouts, and so on. But if you have a fundamental principle that the body has to work hard every day in some form, that's a great goal. Okay, so we know from studies that the more intense your exercise is, the more endorphins you're going to release because your body enters a more stressed state. So something like high intensity interval training releases more of these feel good hormones than just walking or cycling casually. But that's not to say that you won't feel good after any form of exercise. And actually, actually moving your body pretty much always improves your mood afterwards. And that's why it's not that surprising to see that exercise is a great way to reduce depression. And this big study in the bmj, the British medical journal, found that the most effective forms of exercises were walking or jogging, yoga and strength training. Now, the most important takeaway from all of this stuff is that the key thing is to find a form of exercise that you actually enjoy and you can do consistently. If you're approaching exercise with a, I really should exercise that, you know this word should, it's going to create a lot of shame, it's going to create a lot of resistance. When we find a way to A, do the things that we enjoy and B, enjoy the things that we're doing, it becomes more sustainable, it becomes way more energizing. In my case, I really enjoy walking. I go on the walking track outside of my house. I put on my AirPods. I use an app called VoicePal, which is an app that me and my team have built, and I use that as a sort of AI ghostwriter. And I can kind of talk to the app and then the app will sort of ask me follow up questions and then that's how I get my writing done. That's how I script these YouTube videos, by the way, VoicePal is available on both iOS and Android, if you fancy checking it out, if for whatever reason, you would like to make your writing more fun as well. The other thing I really enjoy is racket sp of badminton, tennis and squash. And I find that starting the day or in the middle of the day or the end of the day or pretty much any time I play any of these racket sports, I feel so much better afterwards. I'm so much more energized. And even though it takes energy to play a game of squash or tennis or whatever, the energy that it generates is greater than the energy that it seems to use. And if you want to do some more intense exercise to really maximize the release of your endorphins, then TJ has a fun way of making your body work harder. And he calls it a walk run. And it's basically where you go out on a walk without your phone or headphones, and when you're out there, you try and Pick three moments in that walk where you're going to effectively artificially run away from a bear. So you're going to put your brain through that experience in that moment. If you have three moments, you're on a walk, 20 minute walk, three moments where you just go, oh my God, there's a bear behind me. And you just run as fast as you can. You're then going to every day be getting this activation of this chemical that's constantly de stressing your brain on hearing that you might be thinking, oh my goodness, people are going to think I'm weird if I go. If I'm walking and then I suddenly go for a sprint. What I would say is that's a good thing. It's generally good to do things where people think you're a bit weird because A, it helps you realize that no one actually cares and B, even if they do, it doesn't hurt you and not going to kill you. And I think that sort of don't give an F approach applied to a small thing like running and then walking actually bleeds into other areas of your life. Like if you're struggling to start a YouTube channel or you're struggling to do something a little bit risky because you're worried about what other people will think, doing these little micro habits, micro experiments where you're like not giving a toss about what other people think for a small, you know, a small, tiny sliver of time. I think that just boots boosts the general ability to stop caring what people think. Action number two, heat therapy. All right, so there is a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, and that essentially acts as our internal thermostat. The hypothalamus monitors our core body temperature and it sends signals to the rest of our body to increase or decrease our temperature so that it stays constant. At around 37 degrees Celsius, the hypothalamus communicates with the pituitary gland in our brain. And the reason I'm telling you all this is because when we get hot, the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland to release endorphins into our bloodstream. Anytime in which you put your body in a hot environment, your body experiences this thing called a heat stress response, where similar to running away from the bear, the physical pain that it would get from that, it actually perceives heat, like a sauna or a bath as a similar experience. It doesn't necessarily know that you're not going to stay in that sauna for hours. So it effectively Starts preparing itself for physical danger. As we've already seen with endorphins, they help us a cope with the heat as a form of stress and also increases our mood. But there's actually something even more interesting going on. So our endorphins have these two key effects on our bodies through binding to receptors called mu opioids. Opioid receptors. But we don't just feel better in the moment after heat exposure. It actually lasts for a long time afterwards because the heat increases the number of mu opioid receptors in our brain and bodies. So what this means is that the heat makes us more sensitive to endorphins, and this means that they have a much bigger effect and the effect lasts longer. So, for example, if there was something that you were kind of excited about, like, I don't know, playing World of Warcraft or going for a run or playing squash, if you have exposed your body to heat before doing the thing, then you should feel even better as a result of doing the thing because of this upregulation of mu opioid receptors. So the key takeaway here is to try and expose yourself to heat as often as you can to increase your core body temperature. How long should you spend trying to be hot? Well, it takes around 15 minutes for our body to release endorphins. And so saunas and hot baths or like jacuzzis or whatever are probably the best way to do this, because you would need to stand under a hot shower for a long time to get this effect. Action number three, the song habit. Singing does have a very euphoric effect on our brain. And coming back to the rule of physically pushing your body, if you really sing, it actually puts your body through physical. And you'll notice if you hum a song or if you really sing a song, you'll enjoy singing it much more. From a neuroscientific perspective, that's because the endorphins are releasing as a result of the body going through physical effort. It was really interesting, me hearing this, because I've been singing pretty much my whole life, and I actually often found that, like, when I would be procrastinating from making YouTube videos, or back in the day when I was studying for exams and stuff, and I'd be procrastinating from doing this thing that I had to do. I would often just, like, pick up my guitar or ukulele or set at the piano and just bang out some tunes and sing quite loudly. And if there were people around me, they would join in with the songs and stuff. And it would help me kind of ramp up and get into state to do whatever I wanted to do. I do this so often with my team around me that they actually created a meme for this. Then, yeah, singing just makes you feel way better. And if you're feeling self conscious about it, again, this is one of those things. No one cares. No one cares if you are singing, unless you're, like, doing it in a big corporate workplace. But you actually can just start singing, especially when you're at home, probably singing in the shower. Singing in the shower is great. You could also sing when you're at your desk. You could sing when you're going up and making a cup of coffee. And tj, our neuroscientist friend, recommends that we try and sing for at least five minutes, whether that's in the shower or in the car or when you're on a walk, because it definitely will make you feel a lot better. By the way, as you might have noticed, singing with a group of people or doing exercise with a group of people or working with a group of people makes whatever you're doing feel much better. And that is where the sponsor of this video comes in, which is actually me, because this video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab. If you're the sort of person who works from home a lot, maybe in your day job or maybe on your side Hustle or your book project or your memoir or your YouTube channel or what, and you find yourself sitting at the computer and then not actually doing the thing that you intended to do, then Productivity Lab is going to be absolutely perfect for you. Essentially, Productivity Lab is an online platform and community of entrepreneurs and creators and professionals. And we all get together and we work together through Focus Labs. We do reflective workshops each week where you reflect on how your week has gone and set goals and plan your next week. So it sort of serves as an accountability mechanism. And I like to think of it as like CrossFit or Peloton for Productivity. You're joining a Zoom Co working session with other people. I joined these for three hours each morning because I just get way more work done when I'm in a Focus Lab session, knowing that other people around me on screen virtually are also doing their work. And doing this stuff every day pretty much doubles my productivity. And we've had so many success stories from students in Productivity Lab who've said things like, hey, you know, I've been procrastinating on starting my YouTube channel for ages. And then I joined Focus Lab sessions, and now I'VE actually done it or things like, you know, I've spent five years planning to make this new iOS app that I've been planning to make, and then I never actually did it, but then I joined a few Focus Lab sessions and now I've built my minimum viable product. And so students in Productivity Lab are getting a lot of good results. There's a link down below. You can check out productivitylab.com and you can see if it's the sort of thing that might be right for you. And who knows, maybe I will see you in one of our coworking sessions, or in one of our reflection workshops, or in one of our planning sessions, or in one of our book clubs, or maybe in one of our in person meetups as well. Action number four, the habit of laughter. Okay, so this cool study in 2017 scanned the brains of a group of guys when they watched funny videos on YouTube in a room with two of their close friends. Friends. And what they found was that laughing increased the levels of endorphin in lots of different areas of the brain. So you can see the brain scans here and the hot colors show where there are more endorphins. And we know that these regions of the brain are involved in things like pain processing, reward pathways, and how we feel. So laughing is a really great way of triggering endorphin release, right? Even fake laughter eventually fake laughter because becomes real laughter. This is how I do thumbnails, by the way. When I'm doing thumbnails to these videos, my team will often think I'm really weird because I'll be like, and I put all these faces and other people can't help but start laughing. And it just generally increases the vibe and the mood of everyone around us. Now, the reason why we think that laughing has this effect is because when we laugh, we engage lots of different muscles in our body, like face and stomach and diaphragm. And because the law of endorphins is that physical movement causes endorphin release, the theory is that maybe because laughing is activating all these muscles, that is what is causing the endorphin release. The only question I like would guys sometimes ask himself is if you were to rate yourself on a scale from 1 to 10, how much laughter do you think you have in your life right now? If you answer that in your mind, you might discover that that score isn't 10. It might be more like 5 or 6. Of how much laughter we've seen over our training that we've averaged the number at 5.7 in terms of the amount of laughter people feel they're having. So whilst we know it's something we desire, it's something we're not necessarily getting enough of. So the way to find yourself laughing more, other than faking laughter is to put yourself in environments where you are more likely to laugh. Like, for example, you might call or FaceTime a friend if you're really lonely and you're in a new city, like I am right now. Or you might arrange to meet up with people more often. You could join a local comedy club, the Instagram Reels. You could train your algorithm so that it gives you funny stuff rather than sad stuff. You know, there's all sorts of ways to increase the amount of laughter in your life. All of them are going to feel good for our endorphins level, they're going to be good for our stress levels, they're going to be good for our life overall. Action number five. Up, down, twist. So this last action, action number five is very much aligned with the law of endorphins. Now, as we saw before, yoga is one of the best forms of exercise for reducing depression. And actually, according to this meta analysis, it is almost as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy. And this makes sense because yoga has a lot of benefits like reducing your cortisol levels and stress. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is altered with relaxation instead of the sympathetic fight or flight response nervous system. Yoga also promotes mindfulness. It also releases muscle tightness and increases the flexibility. And all of this helps trigger the release of endorphins. Yoga also has all sorts of spiritual benefits. I am just now starting to get into it because I'm doing a little bit of a spirituality era in my life. But yoga is probably not for everyone and some people do find it hard for various reasons. So the simple act of stretching is actually a good alternative. So I developed like a more simple practice which I call ups, downs and twists, which I do when I wake up in the morning and before I go to sleep. Upstand and twist is literally reach up as tall as you can, reach down to the floor and then twist your spine like this. Oh, feels good. Down. I really need to get better at touching my toes. I'm like, this is how far I go. And twist. I need one of these evidence based stretching routines. But you get the idea. Up, down, twist. And all you need to do is go through these movements twice a day, once in the morning and before you go to to bed. And this would be a very nice way to trigger endorphin release and to reduce your stress levels. And this stuff is actually evidence based, so you might as well. It's just free happiness points that we are otherwise leaving on the table. So that brings us to the end of the video. If you have not yet seen the other three videos in the series, there are going to be in a playlist over here, just underneath this Ravenclaw poster. And those are about the chemicals of dopamine and oxytocin and serotonin. Thank you so much for watching and I will hopefully see you in the next video.

882472-897368: This is the fourth video in a series about dopamine and serotonin","Summary:  
This video explores how to reduce stress by boosting endorphins, featuring insights from neuroscientist TJ Power. It discusses the evolutionary role of physical exertion in stress management and outlines five actionable strategies: daily movement (e.g., ""walk runs""), heat therapy (e.g., saunas), singing, laughter, and yoga/stretching. The video also highlights the risks of chronic sedentary behavior, explains the neuroscience of endorphins, and promotes the sponsor, Productivity Lab, as a productivity tool.  

Chapter Summaries:  
**[00:00-01:01] TJ Power spoke to me about how to reduce stress levels**  
The video introduces TJ Power, a neuroscientist studying dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. Chronic stress affects a third of U.S. adults, and this fourth installment of a series focuses on endorphins—hormones released during physical stress to reduce pain and improve mood. The ""law of endorphins"" emphasizes daily movement, referencing the Hadza tribe’s active rest (e.g., squatting) and contrasting it with modern sedentary habits. Beta-endorphins, linked to ""runner’s high,"" are highlighted as natural painkillers stronger than morphine.  

**[01:01-06:30] Being completely sedentary for long periods of time apparently increases our risk of death**  
Studies on Tanzania’s Hadza tribe reveal they spend 10 hours daily in active rest (e.g., squatting), unlike industrialized populations’ passive rest (e.g., sitting). Prolonged sedentariness increases mortality and disease risk. Evolutionarily, humans coped with stress (hunger/danger) through physical exertion, triggering endorphins. Modern lifestyles lack this exertion, worsening stress. The ""inactivity mismatch hypothesis"" argues that muscle engagement during rest is critical for health.  

**[06:30-09:45] Action number two, heat therapy. Anytime your body is in a hot environment, it experiences stress**  
Heat therapy (saunas, baths) triggers the hypothalamus to release endorphins via the pituitary gland. Heat stress mimics physical exertion, increasing mu opioid receptors, which heighten endorphin sensitivity long-term. A 15-minute heat exposure is optimal. Practical tips include saunas over showers and pairing heat with enjoyable activities (e.g., exercise) for amplified mood benefits.  

**[09:45-11:14] This video is sponsored by our own product, Productivity Lab**  
The host promotes Productivity Lab, a platform for virtual coworking, accountability, and productivity workshops. It’s likened to ""CrossFit for productivity,"" with users reporting success in completing projects (e.g., YouTube channels, apps). Features include Focus Labs (Zoom coworking), reflective workshops, and community events.  

**[11:14-13:13] Action number four, the habit of laughter. The only question I like would guys sometimes ask himself is**  
Laughter triggers endorphin release by activating facial, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles. Brain scans show laughter elevates endorphins in pain/reward regions. Fake laughter can become genuine, and environments like comedy clubs or funny social media boost laughter. The host shares personal anecdotes (e.g., thumbnail-making humor) and suggests self-assessing laughter frequency (average 5.7/10) to prioritize joy.  

**[13:14-14:42] Yoga is one of the best forms of exercise for reducing depression**  
Yoga reduces depression nearly as effectively as cognitive behavioral therapy by lowering cortisol, activating the parasympathetic nervous system, and releasing endorphins. For those averse to yoga, the host recommends ""Up, Down, Twist""—a simplified stretching routine (morning/night) involving reaching, bending, and spinal twists. Evidence supports stretching for endorphin release and stress reduction.  

**[14:42-14:57] This is the fourth video in a series about dopamine and serotonin**  
The video concludes by directing viewers to prior episodes on dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin, linked in a playlist. The series examines brain chemicals influencing daily life, with endorphins as the final focus.  

Key Points:  
- Daily physical exertion (e.g., ""walk runs"") and heat therapy (saunas) boost endorphins, reducing stress.  
- Laughter and singing activate muscles, triggering endorphin release and improving mood.  
- Sedentary lifestyles increase health risks, while active rest (e.g., yoga, stretching) aligns with evolutionary needs.

Insight/Outlook: Integrating evolutionary practices (movement, heat exposure) with modern habits (laughter, community) offers a holistic approach to managing chronic stress."
audio_19.mp3,"In this video we're going to be discussing a simple three step method that you can use to totally transform your life in the next 90 days. I've personally been using this method for years, and since last year I've been hosting free online workshops every few months going through the method. I've taken tens of thousands of people through it and people have gotten enormous value from these sorts of exercises. And if you actually do the things we're going to talk about in this video, then this might be the single most impactful video that you've watched this year. Anyway, in this video we are discussing the three step method, which is reflecting, align and plan. Let's dive into it. All right, so step one is to reflect on where you are currently at and do a bit of a mini life audit. Now I have various different ways of doing this, but I'm going to give you two of my favorites. The first one is an exercise called the Wheel of Life. And actually, if you want, you can do this exercise as you're watching along with this video. And the idea is that we are going to draw ourselves a little wheel and we're going to divide it into three categories for work, health and relationships. Now within those three categories, we're going to further subdivide them into another three categories. So within the category of work, we have mission, money and growth. Within health, we've got body, mind and heart. And then within relationships we've got romantic, family and friends. And now that we've got these nine categories, we want to ask ourselves the question that in each of these categories, how satisfied do I currently feel with where my life is at? And you give yourself a Little rating from 0 to 10 in each of these different categories. And it'll give you a bit of a visual representation of which areas of your life, by your own estimation are going well that you are very satisfied with and which areas have room for improvement. I find this personally to be a very good exercise to do whenever I'm feeling any kind of vague sense of unease about my life. Because then it puts actual, somewhat objective, well, subjective numbers on the thing. And then There is a 10th category that I like to add to the list, which is joy. And I would usually put that outside of the wheel because with all this like personal development stuff, if you watch this channel, you probably watch other personal improvement self development channels in it can be very easy to just be so fixated on growth that we forget to actually enjoy the present moment. And sometimes when I want to figure out how I'm Going to change my life in 90 days. It actually becomes less about. I want to improve personal developmentally in any of these particular areas. And it might just be. I actually want to experience more joy and so, you know, reminders to myself to enjoy the present moment and take a step back and to actually rest. Things like that. So the Wheel of life is one very quick and easy way to reflect on where your life is at right now. There is another one that I like. It's a very simple journaling prompt. And you know, you can take a page, you can do this in a physical journal if you want. I like these particular Harry Potter Moleskine journal book thingies. And you basically split the page into four parts. In the first column you have work. In the second column you have life. And then in the first row you have what's working and in the second row you have what's not working. And then you set a timer for five minutes, you put on some vibey background music, and you just sort of fill in a few bullet points in each of these different categories without overthinking it. Now, I have a little rule for myself whenever I do stuff like this, which is that the what's working category has to have at least twice as many things as the what's not working category. Again, if you are into personal development, you're probably very smart, you're probably very good looking, but you also probably have a tendency to beat yourself up about things that haven't quite gone to plan or that haven't quite gone perfectly. But if the rule for the exercise is that the what's working category must have at least twice as many items in it as the what's not working category, it forces type A people like us to actually find gratitude in the things that we do already have. Because, let's be honest, you know, we all want to change our life in the next 90 days and stuff. But you know, things are going pretty well. You're probably in pretty reasonable physical health. Your mental health is probably pretty reasonable. It could be a lot worse. Sure, your finances maybe aren't quite in the place where you'd want them to be, but you probably have a roof over your head. You're probably watching this on some sort of fancy device, you've probably got an Internet connection, Your friends and family are probably, for the most part, reasonably healthy. Yes, of course we want to grow, but we want to grow from a place of satisfaction with where we currently are at. If we grow from a place of dissatisfaction with where we're currently at that. Actually, you know, I guarantee when your lot in life improves, you will still feel that, that, that dissatisfaction. There's a guy called Brendan Burchard who's a mentor of mine and he has a phrase, strive satisfied. I just love that idea. Strive satisfied. It's okay to strive for more, but we really want to be trying to be satisfied and grateful for where we already are at now. Another very productive way to spend your time is learning. And one of my favorite online learning platforms is skillshare, who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you have been living under a rock and you haven't yet heard, skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives with thousands of classes led by industry pros across film, illustration, design, freelance productivity and more. And I've personally been teaching on Skillshare since 2019. So I've got over 10 classes on Skillshare myself. I've got three that are specifically about productivity and a few more about how to use notion, how to learn Final Cut Pro for video editing, how to start a YouTube channel. And one of my favorite things about Skillshare is that they've got these seasonal updates. For example, in December, the theme of the month was reflection. And if you've been following me for a while, you know how much I love journaling prompts to reflect. And so that was like the theme that skillshare had for that month. And this month their theme is Creativity as a practice. Skillshare can also help you level up in your career with loads of classes around marketing, social media, ui, ux, being a freelancer, and some side hustle ideas as well. So overall you can learn a bunch of personal and professional skills on skillshare. If you are interested in checking out any of these classes or anything skillshare has to offer, including any of my classes, then check out the link in the video description and the first 500 people to use that link will get one month free trial to Skillshare. So thank you so much Skillshare for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it. So we've just done step one, which is to reflect on where our life is currently at, and now let's move on to step two. And step two is to align yourself with a compelling vision for your future. It's very difficult to make any kind of changes to our life if we don't have a compelling vision for where we actually want to go. This doesn't have to be exact, you don't have to know exactly where you want to go. But we do need to have some sort of direction to aim in. Because if the vision, if the future that we're working towards is not actually better than where we're at now, there is. There's no, like, there's no motivation, there's no momentum to actually make any kind of changes to our life. My personal favorite way to create a compelling vision for the future is what I call the three year sketch, which is basically, you imagine today's date three years from now, and then you just generally write down. I like doing it in a physical journal for various reasons. What does life look like today three years from now? If things go according to plan or if things go well, three years from now, where will you be living? What kind of house are you going to be living in? Who are the sorts of people that you have around you? How's your physical health, mental health, emotional health? How meaningful and fulfilling does what you're doing for work actually feel to you? How much spare time do you have to work on passions and hobbies and stuff? Now this is something that takes a little bit of time in my quarterly alignment workshops and annual planning workshops, which I do completely free online. So if you, if you want to join those, you can sign up to my email list and I'll let you know when the next one is. But in those workshops, we do this as like a almost like half an hour visualization. Y you close your eyes and you imagine different futures and stuff. That's generally quite a nice way of doing it because you're sitting down to actually do the exercise and other people, at least on zoom or maybe around you, are also doing the thing. But of course, if you're watching this video, this is the sort of thing you can also do solo. So if you're sitting at your desk or something, I'd suggest if you really want to make the most of this exercise, maybe go for a walk, maybe listen to some nice music. Generally instrumental is better than lyrics and really just try and visualize your absolute best life three years from now. Don't worry about how you're going to get there. Don't allow limiting beliefs and stuff to hold you back. Like, oh, it's not realistic, it's not possible, it's not practical. We don't need to worry about any of that stuff. We just literally want to imagine that visualization. Imagine that dream life three years from now. This is what paints that compelling picture of the future that we want to work towards. And that description should feel exciting. If you look at that description, you should Be like, yeah, that would be pretty fricking sick if I could get there in the next three years. That excitement, that feeling of excitement is what's going to generate the motivation to actually do the things it takes to change your life in the next 90 days. Now I've been doing this for the last several years and I've always just had a three year sketch written out in terms of like what I want either on the computer or on Notion or in my journal. But actually last week my wife Izz hosted a vision boarding workshop for our productivity annual planning event. And for the first time, by following along in that workshop, I actually created my own vision board. And I have my vision board. This is currently what V1 of my vision board looks like. And this only took me about 10, 15 minutes to put together. But actually looking at it now feels, just feels really good. I'm like, oh yeah, I'd love to work towards this sort of thing. So I've got this like jacked dude who's like very flexible because I want to get into martial arts and improve my flexibility and mobility. You know, if my office could look like this with a lot of greenery and a lot of books, that would be pretty cool. It'd be pretty cool to have a really sick house three years from now. This picture here is a co working space or some sort of office. I'd love to build some sort of office for me and my team that like has great vibes and stuff and we can all work in person. These are some random app screenshots that I got off of Pinterest and that feels pretty compelling because me and my team are working on building productivity software. We've released one called VoicePal already. I'll put a link down below if you want to check it out. And there's a couple of others that we're working on. Super focus and progress, pal. And then a couple of others. Three years from now it would be nice to have three kids. Probably not going to happen, but hey, you know, it's the directionality of vision. Why not? I want to get better at singing and guitar and songwriting, which is why there's a picture of John Mayer. This picture is sort of hosting dinners with friends, you know, the social vibes. This is two people doing acro yoga. My wife Izzy is super into yoga. I absolutely suck at like flexibility and so I'd love to be able to do acro yoga with her. I want to get really good at playing squash, this sort of stuff. And actually just seeing this vision board you know, thanks to the workshop that my wife hosted, I'm like, oh, this is so nice. This paints, it genuinely paints a compelling vision for the future that I want to get to. And so when you have one of these compelling future vision Y type things to actually work towards, everything becomes a lot easier in terms of the motivation and momentum to actually do the stuff it takes to change your life in 90 days. If you want to create your own vision board, there are dozens and dozens of YouTube tutorials about how to do so you can just do that. I'm into all this productivity stuff, and for the first time I've made a vision board and I'm like, oh, this is actually quite nice. So I actually would recommend doing this. And that brings us on to step three, which is to plan your two main quests. So there is a productivity strategy that I think is really, really, really helpful for changing your life in any capacity. And that is the concept of quarterly quests. This is basically where you set goals that you're going to accomplish in the next 12 weeks, in the next 90 days, in the next quarter. Hence the phrase quarterly quests. Now, why do I call them quests rather than goals or tasks or projects or objectives? Well, I call them quests because my whole philosophy, which I have spent ages researching in Feel Good Productivity, is that if we can find a way to make our work feel good, to approach our work with more of a sense of play rather than seriousness, then it makes us more productive. And it also gives us more energy to give to the other important areas of our life. Why, with all of this stuff, all of this, like, life improvement stuff, we also want to be careful not to take it too damn seriously. Because if we take it too seriously, if there's this heaviness and importance that we apply to the whole thing, it sucks the fun out of it, it sucks the joy out of it. It leads to burnout, leads to stress, and it actually means we're less likely to actually achieve it. Whereas there's so much evidence that if you can approach things in the spirit of play, in the spirit of fun, finding ways to enjoy it, even with something trivial like calling a 90 day goal a quarterly quest, just makes it feel a little bit more fun, makes it feel like you're on some sort of adventure. Now, the key thing here, and my personal recommendation, is category of work and the category of life. You're only allowed to have one main quest each. There are two mistakes that people make when it comes to this sort of stuff. From what I've seen mistake number one is never setting any goals to begin with. But you're not going to make that mistake because you are here still watching this part of the video. So well done actually for sitting through the rest of this video. That's very good. Most people would have clicked off because like TikTok or Instagram or some other video or some other distraction. So the fact that you're here says a lot about you, says that you can sit through a video that's like at least as long as this one is so well done for that. But the second mistake people make when they get into the whole goal setting thing is just simply setting too many goals. I suspect you are a multi passionate type of person. If you watch this channel, you're pro, you probably have lots of interests, right? Maybe you're interested in personal development, but you're also probably interested in things A, B, C, D, E, F, G. You probably want to do well in work, you want to do well in life, you want to have good friendships, you want to take care of your health. The problem with people like us who are multi passionate who have all these different passions is that it's very easy for us to set all of these different goals in all of these different categories and then never actually make any progress on any of them because we simply have too many goals. And so you can either make a small amount of progress in all of these different directions and not really get anywhere, or you can focus on one thing and make enormous amounts of progress in that particular area. And generally a life transformation in 90 days happens when you pick one thing and you just single mindedly focus on just that one thing. So that is your main quest. So in the category of work, what is the single most important goal or project you need to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your work main quest? Here are some other ways to think about the question what one thing, if accomplished, would move the needle the absolute most? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you most proud? Alternatively, what's the one thing that would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Alternatively, what is the one thing you've been postponing but know it would be transformative if you tackled it? Alternatively, you might think of if I spent the first two hours of my workday purely focused on X, it would have an enormous impact on my work in that world. What is X? Again, I would recommend please pause the video to actually think about it. Because if you pause the video to actually think about this, I can basically guarantee that this video will be the most productive thing that you will do with your time, like this year, by actually watching this video and doing the stuff. Because it's so easy, right? It's so easy for us to just watch productivity videos on the Internet and feel as if we're being productive. But like, you know, if we're not going to do the thing, it's like, what's the point of watching the content? It just becomes sort of mindless entertainment or like productivity pornography at that point, you know, we don't want that. We want to actually do the stuff anyway. Now, once you've got a bit of a sense of what you want your work main quest to be, I actually have a tweak that I would do to this. So I've got a recommended phrasing for how to phrase your work main quest, and this is how I would recommend you phrase it. My work main quest is to. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish in the next 90 days. Because to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have done A, B or C. And we want these to be objective, verifiable criteria that someone else can verify. Did we actually do those things? This feels really exciting and compelling for me because. And here we want to lean into the emotions of it, the emotions of what will actually drive us to do the work it takes to complete the quest. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to. Please feel free to pause the video at this point if you would like to screenshot this or write these down or anything like that. And I'm just about to give you an example of one of my own quarterly quests following this format. All right, so this is my personal example. My work main quest is to make Life OS an absolute banger. Life OS is my productivity course. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because once the course is finished, it becomes our main calling card in the productivity niche other than my book. To complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have launched and delivered cohort number three of the Life Course. Number two, I will have created the Life OS Field Manual with all concepts and tools. And number three, I will have filmed and released the evergreen version of the course. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I get to put all my productivity, knowledge and experience into one thing, package it up nicely, and hopefully turn it into future books and apps, etc. I'm very excited by the Prospect of people using the system to genuinely change their lives. This is where the emotional side of the thing comes into it. Because again, like, like I said, unless you feel expensive, excited to work on this one work main quest, it's just probably not going to happen. And then finally, to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to firstly schedule the first two hours of each workday to work on it until it's done. Number two, log my focus time spent working towards it. And number three, send daily progress updates to the team to hold me accountable. Now, there is a huge amount of magic in phrasing your quests in this way. Like, it does take some time to think about this, but the way I think about it is like changing. Like tweaking the destination that you're going towards actually makes a meaningful difference in where you end up and also the journey you take to get there. It's worth taking a little bit of time just to make sure we're actually going in the right direction, going towards a place we actually want to get to. Because the least productive and the most heartbreaking thing of all is when you spend so much time being productive, being efficient, getting to a destination, only to realize that it was the wrong destination to begin with. And if you just spent a little bit of time thinking about it up front, then maybe the destination could have been improved and you could have saved all that time and effort. Naturally, we don't want this to be a recipe for never doing anything because obviously you can never be fully certain about the course of action you want to take. But it's worth spending, I would say, half an hour, once a quarter to decide, you know, what's really the main thing I want to work towards this quarter. Now we're going to put a couple of more examples of work main quests on the screen. When these examples are on screen, feel free to pause the video if you want to have a closer look at what the example is. This example is for the work main quest of completing a book proposal. This is an example I would have used when I was working as a doctor to apply for core surgical training residency program. And here is an example of maybe your work main quest is actually starting a side hustle of a YouTube channel. This is what that might look like. These are just some random examples that are relevant to my own personal experience. But hopefully you can have a look at these examples and you can see, oh, okay, I see what Ali's doing with these examples that are relevant to him. Great. Let me figure out how I can Apply those sorts of examples to my own situation. And again, if you actually do this, if you actually take the time while watching this video to figure out what is going to be your work main quest for the next 90 days, and you phrase it out in that way and you think about it and you leave a comment down below, I can basically guarantee this is going to be the most productive video you've watched all year. Okay, so at this point we have a work main quest. We are now going to follow a somewhat similar method to have a life main quest. The questions are a little bit different, though. In life, what is the single most important goal or project for you to accomplish in the next three months that is going to be your life main quest? Some other ways of thinking about this. What is the one thing that, if accomplished, would bring the most joy, fulfillment, or peace to your personal life? If you fast forward three months, what is the one accomplishment that would make you feel the most proud? Alternatively, what is the one change that would positively impact every other area of your life? Alternatively, what's the one thing you've been avoiding but know it would have a transformative effect on your relationships or happiness? Or alternatively, you might think if I dedicated one hour of each day purely focused on X, it would have a profound impact on my life. What is X in that context? So these are all of these different prompts. Feel free to pause the video at this point and have a think about it. And now, once you've got a bit of an idea of what your life main quest could be, this is my recommended phrasing for your life main quest. My life main quest is to this is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter. Because to complete the quest, I commit that by 31st March, 2025, I will have done A, B and C, which again, are objective, verifiable criteria. Just as a bit of a tangent here, sometimes I do these workshops and people are like, I commit that I will stop procrastinating. But like, stopping procrastinating is not objective, verifiable criteria, right? Like, you can fool yourself into thinking you stop procrastinating, but you're not actually going to do it. And you've probably been trying to stop procrastinating for like 20 years at this point, and you failed. So, like, we got to change something. Some objective, verifiable criteria in that case might be, I commit that every day I will log my focused minutes and I will get my focused minutes to 180 minutes focused every workday. 80% of the time that would be something that someone else could verify that they can be like, hey, where's your focus log if you don't know what a focus log is? I have done a whole three part series on how to focus better. I talk about it way more in there, but basically you're just tracking the amount of time you're spending focusing and that is completely needle moving for your ability to focus. That's how you turn something intangible, like I want to stop procrastinating into something that's a little bit more tangible, which makes it more likely that you'll actually achieve it. Okay, that was a bit of a tangent. Let's keep going. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because and finally to make sure I complete the quest, I am going to again feel free to pause to take a screenshot and actually we'll put this stuff in the video description down below as well so you don't have to like take notes. You can just like look at it in the video description. Now here's an example from my own personal life for my quarterly quest for the next 90 days, my life main quest is to build a martial arts habit into my life. This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because I've been putting it off for years and it'll have a transformational effect on my health and hopefully my ability to defend myself and my family. If anyone starts on me to complete the quest, I commit that in the next 90 days I will have attended at least 12 classes, averaging one per week throughout the quarter. This feels really exciting and compelling for me because I've been wanting to do martial arts stuff for ages and by making this quest happen I'll figure out which one I enjoy, where I enjoy doing it, and can get started on climbing this new mountain of adventure. To make sure I complete the quest, I am going to spend an hour tomorrow making a notion page with all nearby options. Ask my wife Izzy to hold me accountable to this. Thirdly, check in with myself each week as part of my weekly review to make sure I've got a class scheduled for the following week and four mention it in a YouTube video. So it would be pretty embarrassing if me as a self anointed productivity expert doesn't actually manage to do it. So that is my life main quest. I'm going to give you a couple of other examples as well. So this is an example from let's say fitness and this would be an example from the world of dating at this point if you've actually done the exercise, you might be thinking, oh, but, but I have other things I want to do and the other things that are not the one most important thing, I think of those as side quests. And I tell myself, for work and life I'm allowed to have two or three side quests. But the main quest is the one that absolutely has to be done. And the side quests are more of a nice to have. It's like I'm not going to beat myself up too much if I don't manage to do it. Like I'm not marshaling all my effort and focus towards those things. I am really focusing on my main quest. And then the side quests are like, you know, kind of whatevs. Now if you actually do these three steps, number one, reflect, number two, align, and number three, plan your main quest for work and life, I can pretty much guarantee that you will have set yourself up to actually make a transformational change to your life in the next 90 days. Of course, once you've set the goal, you actually have to achieve the goal. And if you're interested in that, I have a video over here which is five very simple evidence based things you can do to massively increase the odds that you're actually going to do the thing that you've just set out to do. So check out that video over there. Thank you so much for watching. Bye.","80-30202: This video discusses a simple three step method that can transform your life

This video presents a three-step method to transform one's life in 90 days: **Reflect** (assessing current satisfaction via tools like the Wheel of Life), **Align** (creating a compelling vision for the future using vision boards or three-year sketches), and **Plan** (setting focused quarterly quests for work and life). The host emphasizes gratitude, playfulness, and avoiding overcommitment, while promoting Skillshare as a learning resource.  

---

### Chapter Summaries:  

**[00:00-00:30] This video discusses a simple three-step method that can transform your life**  
The video introduces a three-step framework (Reflect, Align, Plan) to achieve life transformation in 90 days. The host shares his experience using this method in workshops, claiming its impact if viewers take actionable steps.  

**[00:30-04:04] Brendan Sturch recommends doing a mini life audit to improve your satisfaction**  
The ""Wheel of Life"" exercise evaluates satisfaction across nine categories (work: mission/money/growth; health: body/mind/heart; relationships: romantic/family/friends) and adds a 10th category, *joy*, to counterbalance over-fixation on growth. A journaling prompt splits ""work"" and ""life"" into ""what’s working"" (requiring twice as many entries as ""what’s not"") to cultivate gratitude. The host stresses striving from satisfaction, not dissatisfaction, citing Brendan Burchard’s ""strive satisfied"" philosophy.  

**[04:04-05:12] Skillshare is the largest online learning community for creatives**  
A sponsored segment highlights Skillshare’s courses on creativity, productivity, and career skills. The host promotes his own classes (e.g., Notion, YouTube channel setup) and Skillshare’s seasonal themes (e.g., reflection, creativity). A free trial link is offered to the first 500 viewers.  

**[05:12-09:24] Step one is to reflect on where your life is currently at**  
Expands on reflection tools: the Wheel of Life helps visualize life balance, while journaling forces acknowledgment of positives. The host advises grounding growth in gratitude (e.g., health, stable relationships) to avoid toxic productivity.  

**[09:24-11:59] There is a productivity strategy that I think is really helpful for changing your life**  
Introduces ""quarterly quests""—90-day goals framed as playful ""quests"" to reduce burnout. The host shares his vision board (martial arts, productivity software, family goals) as a motivator and explains how a compelling vision fuels momentum.  

**[12:00-16:04] What is your work main quest for the next three months**  
Work main quests should be singular, emotionally compelling, and verifiable. A template includes objective commitments (e.g., ""launch cohort three of Life OS""), excitement drivers, and accountability steps. The host’s example prioritizes focused daily time and team updates.  

**[16:04-16:56] Use these examples to help you figure out what your work main quest is**  
Examples include completing a book proposal, applying for surgical residency, or starting a YouTube channel. The host advises avoiding vague goals (e.g., ""stop procrastinating"") in favor of measurable actions (e.g., logging focused hours).  

**[16:56-19:01] Use these questions to help you identify your life main quest**  
Life quests focus on joy/fulfillment, such as fitness habits or dating goals. The host’s quest (attending 12 martial arts classes) includes accountability via Notion planning, spousal check-ins, and public commitment.  

**[19:01-21:22] Plan your main quest for work and life for the next 90 days**  
Finalizes the method: prioritize one work and one life quest, with optional side quests. The host warns against spreading focus too thin and links to a video on goal achievement strategies.  

---

### Key Points:  
- Use the **Wheel of Life** and gratitude journaling to assess satisfaction and avoid toxic productivity.  
- Create a **compelling vision** (e.g., vision boards, three-year sketches) to align actions with meaningful goals.  
- Set **single quarterly quests** for work and life, emphasizing playfulness and verifiable outcomes.  
- Avoid overcommitment; focus on 1–2 ""main quests"" to drive transformational progress.  

**Tags:** productivity methods, life planning, goal setting, personal development, quarterly goals  

**Insight/Outlook:** Combining structured self-assessment with playful, focused goal-setting can sustainably bridge the gap between current reality and aspirational futures."
audio_20.mp3,"This is a video on how to get rich. Why am I making a video on how to get rich? When I was working as a doctor and doing the YouTube and business stuff on the side, no one ever asked me, how do you get rich? They would always ask me, how do you manage your time? How do you, how do you be so productive? And all of this, all of this sort of stuff. But now like eight years into this journey, I've now built a multimillion dollar business. I have a team. I never have to work again a day in my life if I don't want to. Now when I give talks and when I do Q&As and when I do like events and stuff, people will come up to me and ask questions. And the questions are no longer about how do you manage your time and how do you be productive. The questions like 90% of them are basically, how do you get rich? It's framed in different ways. You know, what's your advice for getting a high paying job? What's your advice for having a side hustle that makes enough money for me to quit my job? What's your advice for, you know, how I can have a six figure lifestyle business doing what I love? And I want to talk about something that I don't think I've talked about on this channel before. Basically. Back in 2015, I was in my third year of medical school. It's a six year degree at Cambridge University. And after three years we have like a halfway graduation type thing. I was at this halfway graduation with the other medical students in my college. There were like 15 of us and sitting with our professors who'd gotten to know us over the last three years. And one of the questions in the yearbook that the medics were talking about was which of us is most likely to become a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which means you're no longer allowed to practice medicine because they've deemed you incompetent. They've struck you off the medical register. Big deal. And one of the professors who had known me for three years and had taught me said, oh, it's obviously Ali. And I was like, oh shit. At the time, I had not started this YouTube channel. This was 2015. I started the channel in 2017. At the time, I spent quite a lot of effort, like trying to, trying to be a good doctor, trying to sort of do my, you know, get the grades and, you know, whatever. And I got a first class degree in one of my exams. And then that year I sort of ranked in the Top two in the subject and like won a prize and stuff. I thought I was pretty dedicated to medical school stuff. And this professor who I really looked up to casually in the, in a dinner context, I was like, oh, you know, which of us is most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register? Which is like a really bad thing. He just, he, he, he said it would be me. I'd be most likely to be a millionaire but be struck off the medical register. I didn't actually get struck off the medical register, thank goodness. I voluntarily took my name off of it when, when I, when I quit medicine to do full time business entrepreneurship type stuff. But that made me feel pretty bad. I was like, huh, like part of me was like, oh, he thinks I'm gonna be a millionaire. But the bigger part of me was like, holy. He thinks that my pursuit of money is gonna get me struck off the medical register. What? I think the only reason I got rich, or the main reason, not the only reason the main reason I got rich was because I had an unhealthy obsession with making money. An unhealthy obsession with making money. There's a thread on Reddit, there's like a junior doctors subreddit and someone like posted something, a few like last year like what do you think of Ali Abdaal? You know, and some comments on this thing were like, oh, you know, I like his productivity content and he helped me study for my exams. But there were a bunch of comments being like, you know, that dude is totally obsessed with money. He's just obsessed. He has an orgasm thinking about money. Dude is so obsessed with making money. And it's interesting because this is now like 10 years on. This is 10 years after that graduation dinner where my professor basically told me I was obsessed with making money. To now people on the Internet telling me I'm obsessed with making money. And honestly, it's true, it's true. During the era where my business grew from zero to five figures to six figures to seven figures and suddenly I was making more money than a doctor would earn in a lifetime in a year. In that era I was totally obsessed with making money. If you want to get rich, I kind of think you need to be obsessed with making money. I'm sorry, I think that's it. I know a lot of people who are rich now. You know, when you become rich, you start hanging out with other people who are very rich. I've been on business trips and stuff with people with net worths in the multi seven figures. That is up to $10 million. Like one to $10 million. I've hung out with people who are and have net worths in the 10 to $100 million. I interviewed a guy, he's now a friend of mine, actually. He wrote a book called Never Enough. His name's Andrew Wilkinson. He's a billionaire with a B, like, net worth of a thousand million dollars plus. I have gotten to know a lot of really rich people. I have not met a single one who was not unhealthily obsessed with the goal of making money, with the goal of getting rich, with the goal of building their business. Once they get rich, that is when they start thinking about work, life, balance. That's when they start doing side quests, right? You know, bro has completed the main storyline by getting rich and now bro is doing side quests. That's when they take up martial arts. That's when they take up video gaming. It's when they start writing books about, like, how to be more productive and how to, like, live your best life. And, you know, I know lots of people who got rich through the process of them getting rich. They were married and had kids and pretty much all of them felt as if they weren't present enough for their relationship and for their family. And then they get rich and then they realize, you know, there was a guy I was speaking to, he was like 42 or something. He was rich, way richer than I am, as I would estimate his net worth to be in the 10 to $100 million range. Ish. He. I was chatting to him about a year ago on a trip, and he said that his unhealthy obsession with growing his business meant that he missed the first, like 10 years of his kid's childhood because he was always working and was on the brink of divorce because he was always working. And it was just a stroke of luck that saved his marriage. And he became less obsessed with making money then and started to think about work, life, balance. This is a video on how to get rich. How do you get rich? By having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich to the point often that it sacrifices other areas of your life. In my case, I'm kind of lucky that my unhealthy obsession with getting rich, the thing that it sacrificed was my medical career. Thankfully, it didn't sacrifice it in the way that the medical career was taken away from me by force, by me getting struck off the medical register, but it basically sacrificed my medical career because my obsession, my unhealthy obsession with getting rich made me build Businesses and stuff. And I realized I enjoyed that more. And then I left the day job. That's actually very fortunate. If I'd gotten married and had kids and then developed an unhealthy obsession with getting rich or had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich and was growing my business and stuff to the point where I then got married and had kids, that unhealthy obsession with getting rich might well have caused me to look back on my time with regret, thinking, man, I missed my kid's childhood. As I was getting rich, I had in the back of my mind that, like, okay, this is fine, but really the important things in life are, like, health and relationships and stuff. And, like, I don't want to. I don't want to screw this up, you know? A really good book is How Will youl Measure youe Life by Clayton Christensen. A book like Designing youg Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. There's books like Sahil's the Five Types of Wealth, which talks about how financial wealth is only one type of wealth. I think I managed to avoid a lot of the really negative consequences of being unhealthily obsessed with making money, thankfully. But it's interesting that even though I managed to avoid those consequences, my professor 10 years ago thought I was obsessed with making money. Random people on the Internet now think I'm still obsessed with making money. Maybe it's true. Let's say you have a dream to become, like a professional athlete, right? You want to play football professionally, you want to play squash or tennis professionally. Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it? Yeah, pretty much. Like, if you look at the training regimens of people who make it professionally, like top 1% people in any sport, from the outside, it looks as if they have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. They're just obsessed with it. It's all they think about. They live and breathe the thing. Their entire life is focused around the thing. And they go for that thing. Timothy Chalamet, famous actor, talked about how he wants to be one of the greats. He wants to be a great actor. And I know we're in a subjective business, but the truth is I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight. It's kind of unusual. Like, you know, we've been in an era where aspiring to Greatness is like frowned upon. You kind of want to be humble about it. Like, oh, you know, I just stumbled into acting. I don't know how I got these roles. I didn't try very hard. Like being a try hard is considered, used to be considered a bad thing. But I think people like Timothy Chalamet are making it cool to be a tryhard. He's being a try hard. He wants to be one of the great actors. That means he probably has an unhealthy obsession with the craft of acting, which is how he's, he's getting there and also he's really good looking and stuff and also a great actor. But you don't get there without having an unhealthy obsession with the thing. Everyone who has a top 1% or above outcome in anything tends to have an unhealthy obsession with the thing. We don't look down upon it when it's an Olympic athlete or when it's a musician or when it's a concert violinist or when it's an actor or something. But when it comes to making money, there's something about that that we like to look down upon. If you want to get rich, you probably don't look down upon it, right? I mean, if you're watching this video, you probably wouldn't look down upon someone who has an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. But if you want to get rich and you're at this point in the video and you've sat through me talking about how I think the way to get rich is to have an unhealthy obsession with it, your friends and family will probably look down on you for having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. Especially if you are in a country like the UK and I've heard Canada similar to this. I think in the US they're a bit more chill about, you want to get rich, go for it. Like, you know that kind of rah rah helping like big. You up for wanting a big outcome in the UK and a lot of European countries and I've heard Canada is like this as well. It's more like, you want to get rich, bro, what's wrong with you? Like, you know, think about the finer things in life. Like money won't buy you happiness, it's not going to make you happy. Like, you know, why, why do you need to get rich? Like there's this whole like this thing, this idea that if you're trying to get rich that is somehow bad. And I don't know, maybe it Is. Maybe it is. But, like, again, I don't know anyone who's gotten rich without being unhealthily obsessed with it. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? By becoming unhealthily obsessed with getting rich. What does it look like to be unhealthily obsessed with getting rich? I was having a conversation with a friend. This is a friend who wants to be rich. She wouldn't say, I want to be rich, but what she would say is, oh, I'd love to have a lifestyle business that helps me make at least £10,000amonth so that I can retire my parents, so that I can work whenever I want, wherever I want, and do work I love with people I love. That basically translates to I want to be rich, right? You know, how many people have the money to be able to retire their parents, have a lifestyle business, work from wherever they want, whatever they want, making at least 10,000amonth in profit. Like, man, basically, she wants to be rich, right? And so we kind of had that bit of a conversation, and I was like, come on, man, you know, let's call a spade a spade. Is it fair to say that you want to be rich? She was like, yeah, I want to be rich. I was like, great, fantastic. You know, we're owning the fact that we want to be rich. She was saying that she's doing all these different things, but feels like she's stuck in one place because she's not actually becoming rich. And she's been watching the content and reading some of the books that I've been recommending and stuff, because, you know, she watches the channel occasionally, but she's still no richer than she was five years ago. She is still stuck in her job that she enjoys sometimes and doesn't enjoy something like, whatever. Still stuck in a job, not getting rich. And so we're kind of talking about this. You know, she is training for a marathon, and at the same time, she wants to create YouTube videos exploring her artistic side. And at the same time, she wants to document her life on Instagram because it gives her artistic fulfillment to do that. And at the same time, she wants to host events for friends because she's very sociable and enjoys hanging out with friends. And at the same time, you know, she really cares about her family, wants to spend a lot of time hanging out with the family and visiting her parents a lot, and, like, just has all these different things that she wants to do. And she also has a day job, for the record. So it's like you know, 40 to 50 hours of a week are taken up by the day job. I asked a simple question. I was like, okay, let's call her Jane. Okay, Jane, how many hours a week would you say you are devoting to the goal of getting rich? And she had never thought about this question before, like literally never. It's like for five years she'd had the goal of 10 years she'd had the goal of I want to get rich. Was worried, was wondering why she's not there yet, which is why she was talking to me about this, because it was a conversation about how to get rich, basically. And I asked, how many hours a week are you dedicating to the goal? And she was like, oh, damn. I mean, I've got my day job. And I was like, okay, come on, you know, let's be honest. The day job is probably unlikely to get you rich. The way you get rich from a day job is either you work in tech or you work in finance. Those are broadly the two fields where your day job can get you rich, tech and finance. Is there anything else? Pretty much just tech and finance, right? If you have a really high paying job in tech or a really high paying job in finance, you can get rich off that, right? Because you make way more money than you spend even if you're living in London. And if you're living in London, you're making 500 grand, you're only only spending 100 grand on like rent and food and drinks and shit, you've got 400 grand left, taxes, etc. Etc. Put it in an index fund S&P 500. Compounding by the time you're about 40, you'll be rich if you work in finance. Similarly, if you work in tech, this person Jane does not work in finance or tech. Therefore, being honest, she's unlikely to get rich off of her day job. So time spent working towards a day job broadly does not really count for the goal of trying to get rich. Basically, it transpired she was spending zero hours a week focused on the goal of getting rich. Let's say you're trying to become a professional athlete, let's say a professional football player. How many hours a week would you need to be dedicating to that goal of being a professional footballer? Like many, many, many hours a day, forever, for like a 10 year period. And yet my friend Jane had the goal of being rich, which is a 1% goal, and was putting zero effort towards the thing. And we realized at the end of the conversation that this is a big Part of why she feels sad a lot of the time that she's not getting to where she wants to be because she wants to be here. And the actions that she's taking are completely devoid, are completely decorrelated from like this, this thing that she wants. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? So we talked about kind of the hours per week that you're spending trying to get rich. What else does an unhealthy obsession look like? I want to tell you a little story and I want to compare. In this little story, I'm going to take a snapshot of my life right now in 2025. I'm currently 30 years old. 3, 0. And I want to compare it with a snapshot of my life. Let's say five years ago. Yeah, five years ago it would have been 2020. That was when I was in the peak of my getting rich phase. 2020 was the year where I went from earning a hundred thousand a year on my YouTube business to like 1.2 million a year for my YouTube business for the regular. So 202020 was a massive year of growth. I want to talk about the idea of mental bandwidth and content. Content, content diet. So back in 2020, there were two types of content that I was consuming. Number one was fantasy fiction, audiobooks on my drive to and from work some of the time and while I was at the gym some of the time. That was maybe 10% of my content consumption. The other 90% of my content consumption was about getting rich. It wasn't explicitly about getting rich. Back in 2020, there wasn't that much content about it, but it was about business. It was about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to literally all of the podcasts about how to grow a YouTube channel. I was listening to all of the podcasts about how to build a business and how to market a business. The Smart Passive Income podcast, the Online Marketing Made Easy podcast, Noah Kagan's podcast. I was reading all the books, listening to all the audiobooks about business, the E. Myth Revisited and Traction, and dozens and dozens of books and audiobooks about how to get rich. 90% of the stuff that I was consuming that I was listening to every single day at like two times and three times speed was content about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What that unhealthy obsession looks like is that in your discretionary time, in your spare time, the thing that you are thinking about the things, the thing that you're consuming content about the thing you're reading about the thing you're listening about, the things you are listening to, stuff about the thing you're watching videos on is on how to get rich. Going back to this friend, Jane, I also asked her, how much time do you spend watching or reading or listening to content that is specifically towards this goal of getting rich? And she said, well, I watched a lot of content about, like, content creation because I'm interested in that. I'm like, okay, but like, do you plan to get rich through content creation? And she was like, okay, probably not, right? She's doing the content creation thing as a hobby rather than as a vehicle to getting rich. And I was, okay, do you watch or listen or to read anything else about getting rich? And she was like, I sometimes watch some of your videos about finance and stuff, but other than that, not really. And so this is someone who has the goal of getting rich, which is like a 1% goal, because, you know, let's say rich is top 1%, however you want to define it, whatever. And she's putting zero hours a week towards the goal. Acting. Acting towards the goal of getting rich. And she's putting zero hours a week of consuming content towards the goal of getting rich. That is not what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like, unfortunately. Yeah. So back in 2020, when I was in the process of getting rich, when my income 10x'd, I was listening to some fantasy audiobooks, I was occasionally going to the gy, but literally all of the rest of my time, even while I was at work, in my day job, all of the rest of my time was focused on how do I do stuff towards building my business and therefore getting rich, or how do I learn stuff towards the goal of building my business and therefore getting rich. And my personal view is, I think that's what it takes. I think that's what it takes. It's so hard to get rich. It's not an easy thing. Social media will make you think it's an easy thing. Social media will make you think that you can, you know, get super rich. And while you're in the process of getting super rich, you can also have a balanced life, right? You can go to the gym, you can have your friends and family, you can go on the holidays, you can do the things, you can have so much fun. You can train for a marathon, you can do a hyrox, whatever the fuck a hyrux is. You can do all those things. In reality, those are the things that rich people do once they are already rich. They are not. The things that they did while they were on the way, while they were switching from day job earning 50 grand to business earning 500 grand, while they were growing the business from like, you know, 100k in revenue and no profit to a million in revenue and like lots of profit. Like generally, pretty much everyone I've spoken to who has been in that position has been unhealthily obsessed with the goal of getting rich or building a business or whatever the vehicle say words getting rich. They are unhealthy obsessed with that goal to the point that it has created imbalance in their life because they've been single mindedly pursuing that goal. This is a video about how to get rich. How do you get rich? You become unhealthily obsessed with goal. What else does an unhealthy obsession with a goal look like? So I talked about what my life was like back in 2020. I want to contrast that with what it's like in 2025. Let's have a look through my YouTube feed. A man's content feed can tell you a lot about what they value and what their priorities are. So let me show you what my YouTube feed looks like these days. Okay. A video from Alex O'Connor about philosophy. A community post from Leila Hormozi. A Gary's economics video about why growth is stupid. Okay. Oh, here we go. Simon Squibb. This is a video about how to get rich. I have one video about how to get rich. Method versus mythic. Sprocket monger. Lemonstock Lock and stock protection warrior pov. This is a video about World of Warcraft. This is not a video about getting rich. Shorts is this rogue genius? Another video about World of Warcraft. Why you can tax billionaires. This is a economics type thing. Another World of Warcraft thing. Oh, Alex Formosi video about getting rich. This new weapon modification is amazing. For speedruns in Horizon. Forbidden West. This is not a video about getting rich. This is a video about a video game. Hmm. Sahil Bloom quote. This is a video about how to get ripped, which is not about getting rich. This is a Dorover CEO episode about fear and anxiety. This is Rory Sutherland not about getting rich. I don't know what this is. This is another World of Warcraft video. Not a video about getting rich. This is an art video. Because I'm doing a side quest and learning how to draw. You know, bro is running side quests. I'm doing a side quest and I just completed Horizon Forbidden west on the PlayStation 5. I've gotten back into World of Warcraft, the War within season two on my character, which is a paladin where I'm trying to play Holy and Prot and retribution and stuff. I'm trying to learn how to draw. I'm running, running all these various different side quests. I'm taking Muay Thai lessons. I'm starting going to the gym very regularly. I'm taking squash lessons. Here's a book. This is one on how to get rich. I've read this book, by the way. It's a good book. This is music. Another side quest I'm running is trying to improve my guitar, piano and singing skills. Not a video about how to get rich. This is Lewis Howes and Jay Shetty, sort of a video about how to get rich, but not really. They're gonna talk about, like, feelings and stuff. World of Warcraft, Iman Ghazi video about how to get rich. So sell something. Video about how to get rich. Survive or thrive. I don't know what that means. Australian Grand Prix, Networking, storytelling. Not about rich. Not about getting rich. I worked out like David Goggins for a hundred days. Not about getting rich. My content feed these days reflects what my priorities are. If you were to look at that, what would you say are the things that Ali Abdel cares about according to his YouTube thing? According to his YouTube feed, he cares about World of Warcraft, cares about gaming on the horizon, Forbidden west cares, cares a little bit about making money. Because, you know, 20% of the videos are about how to get rich. Cares about becoming healthy. A handful of those videos were about, like, health and stuff. If you'd looked at this, like, two weeks ago, it was, like, filled with, like, baby gear recommendations. Cause I was on a fricking rabbit hole about, like, you know, we've got a baby on the way. And like, researching the absolute best crib, pram, stroller, car seat, this, that and the other. And so my entire YouTube feed was recommendations for, like, baby gear. If you compared this to my YouTube feed back in 2020, all you would have seen is content about how to get rich, content about how to build a business, content about how to manage a team, content about how to grow a YouTube channel, content about how to grow on social media, content about sales funnels and all of this sort of stuff. That's all you would have seen. This video is about how to get rich. The way you get rich is by having an unhealthy obsession with getting rich. What does that look like? What it looks like is that your content diet is towards that unhealthy obsession with getting rich. The unfortunate truth is that the more different goals you're working towards, the more balanced your life is, the less likely you are to get rich. Maybe there are a handful of exceptions to this rule, but in general, the pattern I've seen through, I know, I know a hell of a lot of people who are rich. I've interviewed a lot of them on podcast, read a bunch of their books. None of basically 100% of them did not have much of a balanced life while they were in the process of getting rich. They started, they got rich first and then they got the balanced life second. I am not saying that this is what you should do. I am saying that if you have the goal of getting rich, any or, or becoming a professional athlete, or becoming a professional actor, or becoming a professional musician, anything where this is a goal that only 1% of people attain. Like, to be better than 99 of people requires you to be more dedicated than 99 of people generally requires you to work harder than 99 of people. People say, you know, work, but, but I can work smart. It's like, okay, but like everyone else is also trying to work smart. Like, also when you're a beginner at the thing, you don't know what working smart looks like. Like, when you're a beginner to the goal of getting rich, are you building business or whatever, you just have to work really hard. And in the process of working really hard, you will figure out, what does working smart look look like so that further down the line, you can now work smart. Right now I don't need to work that hard right now. My multi and deca millionaire friends don't need to work very hard. They still choose to anyway because they're kind of obsessed. Still, a lot of them are obsessed. But you know, the ones with families and like balance, they don't need to work very hard. Why? Because they have employees who do the hard work for them. They've got systems, they've got leverage, they've got personal brands, they've got books, they've got passive income assets. They don't need to work hard anymore. But all of them had an unhealthy obsession with getting rich while they were younger, when they were building it up. So if you're at this point in the video and you would like to get rich, it's really worth asking yourself, do you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Would your friends and family say that you have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich? Does your content diet reflect an obsession with getting rich? Does the way you spend your time reflect an obsession with getting rich? If the answer is no, then you have two options. I think all of this is just my opinion. Whatever. I think you have two options here. Either you can decide to develop an unhealthy obsession. You can change your content diet. You can start consuming all the content about getting rich. You can start waking up two hours early before your day job, putting an effort towards building your business. You can start while you're at your day job, taking slightly longer lunch breaks and using, squeezing in half an hour of, like, work on your business here and there in the evenings. You can not go out with your friends every night or whatever thing. You can stop playing freaking video games. You can stop watching Netflix, stop watching random YouTube videos, even videos like this one and only. Ever work on your business while you're going on a walk, while you're doing the dishes. You can switch your content diet so that you are listening to audiobooks and podcasts and videos about getting rich. On weekends. You can be like, oh, weekends, incredible. I've got, like, 16 full hours on Saturday and 16 full hours on Sunday where I can literally just wake up, lock myself in a room, work for 16 straight hours on my business. That is what an unhealthy obsession with getting rich looks like. That is often what it takes. Getting rich is not easy. That's option number one. If you decide that, hey, I want to get rich, I trust Ali's advice on this. I trust that he knows what he's talking about, sort of somewhat anecdotally, and I trust that, okay, I currently don't have an unhealthy obsession with getting rich, and I would like to develop one. Or you can decide. You know what? Actually, this. This isn't for me. I. If getting rich requires having an unhealthy obsession to the point where my life becomes imbalanced, if getting rich requires me to stop running my marathons and stop hanging out with friends and, like, work on the weekends and, like, wake up a bit earlier to work before work and, like, work during work, if getting rich requires my medical school professors to think I'm going to get struck off the medical register because, like, I'm so obsessed with getting rich, man, if that's what's required to get rich, I actually don't want to be rich. If that's the path you want to go down, man, I'm so glad you watched this video because this video might have saved you all of this angst that you've currently got from, like, you have a goal of getting rich, but you're not doing the thing, which is to have an unhealthy obsession in terms of action. And in terms of, like, learning towards getting rich, you could just decide to make the goal less ambitious on that front. I'm not putting a moral judgment on this. I'm not saying anyone should have a goal of getting rich. I'm not saying getting rich is a morally good thing or a morally bad thing. It's a morally neutral thing. In the same way, I'm not saying that being a professional football player is good or bad. It just. It just is what it is. If you have the goal of being a professional football player, it makes sense that you're either willing to put in the effort required to be a professional football player or not. But if you're not willing to put in the effort, you're not willing to pay the price that it takes to become a professional football player. Why set yourself the goal of becoming a professional football player? The more we have this gap, the gap between where we want, the gap between the thing that we want and the actions we're taking, this gap creates misery. Misery is created in the gap. If I have the goal of being a professional squash player, for example, I don't. But if I did, and I'm only training two hours a week, I'm like, bro, that's going to make me miserable because I'm never going to get to that goal by only 22 hours a week. Similarly, if you have the goal of getting rich and you're not willing to pay the price, which in my opinion is having an unhealthy obsession with it, to the point that the rest of your life becomes imbalanced if you're not willing to pay that price, either become willing to pay the price, that is, become unhealthily obsessed, or just don't have it as a goal. You know, various people in my team, for example, are totally chill not being rich. They do not have the goal of becoming financially free, financially independent. The ones that do often tend to go out and start their own business and then they make videos about why they left the Alibda team to start their own business and they've joined our team, got inspired and started to, and decided to run their own businesses. Cause they wanted to get rich, right? But there's a lot of people in my team who are like, you know what? I don't really wanna get rich. I just want a nice job that pays reasonably well, that gives me flexibility, that gives me fun, gives me autonomy, lets me learn, and lets me hang out with people that I like, and lets me travel the world while I'm doing it. That's actually the position of, like, half the people in my team. They're like, you know what? Actually, this is great. I love my job. I love my life. That's fantastic. They do not have the goal of getting rich. And therefore, the fact that they're not unhealthily obsessed with getting rich is fine. It's not causing any misery because there's. There's no misalignment. But there are various people I know, including Jane, for example, who has a job and has the goal of getting rich, which is there. And her actions are here. And she feels misery every day because she feels the pain of misalignment, the pain that her goals are misaligned with her actions. And whenever you're in a situation where what you want is misaligned with what you are doing, it creates misery. So either change what you're doing or change what you want. That's my honest advice. That's my hot take on how to get rich. And if you enjoyed that video, then you will absolutely love my weekly email newsletter. It's called Life Notes, and it's where I share whatever I'm learning, watching, listening to, and just notes that I'm generally taking away from my work and my life. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found this useful, and I'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye.","160-48406: This is a video on how to get rich. When I was working as a doctor, no one ever asked me

**Chapter Summaries:**  
**[00:00-00:48] This is a video on how to get rich. When I was working as a doctor, no one ever asked me**  
Ali introduces the video by contrasting his early career as a doctor (where questions focused on productivity) with his current status as a multimillionaire entrepreneur. He notes that people now primarily ask him about wealth-building. He recounts a 2015 medical school incident where a professor predicted he’d become a millionaire but lose his medical license due to his money obsession, foreshadowing the video’s theme.  

**[00:48-07:20] Ali Abdaal says he had an unhealthy obsession with making money**  
Ali admits he was unhealthily obsessed with money during his business growth phase, citing Reddit comments criticizing his fixation. He argues that most wealthy people (including billionaire Andrew Wilkinson) share this trait, often sacrificing relationships or family time. He acknowledges his luck in avoiding personal life fallout but warns viewers about potential regrets, referencing a friend who nearly divorced due to workaholism.  

**[07:20-07:39] Do you need to have an unhealthy obsession with the sport to make it professionally**  
Ali draws parallels between wealth-building and professional athletics, asserting that top performers in any field (e.g., actors like Timothée Chalamet) exhibit obsessive dedication. He critiques societal hypocrisy that praises obsession in arts/sports but frowns on it in finance, especially in cultures like the UK or Canada.  

**[07:39-10:07] Timothy Chalamet talked about how he wants to be a great actor**  
Expanding on the previous chapter, Ali highlights Timothée Chalamet’s public ambition to be a ""great actor"" as evidence of necessary obsession. He contrasts this with societal pressures to downplay ambition, arguing that ""try-hard"" attitudes are essential for exceptional success but stigmatized in financial contexts.  

**[10:07-13:37] I was having a conversation with a friend who wants to be rich**  
Ali describes a conversation with ""Jane,"" a friend who claims to want wealth but spends no time on wealth-building activities. He critiques her divided focus (marathons, content creation, family) and explains that high-paying jobs outside tech/finance rarely lead to riches. He compares her lack of effort to the rigorous training of professional athletes.  

**[13:37-14:18] What else does an unhealthy obsession look like?**  
Ali argues that obsession manifests in consuming content aligned with wealth-building. In 2020, 90% of his media intake (podcasts, books) focused on business growth. He contrasts this with Jane’s unrelated content habits, stressing that mental bandwidth must prioritize financial goals.  

**[14:18-19:44] 90% of my content consumption in 2020 was about getting rich**  
He details his 2020 routine: listening to business podcasts (e.g., *Smart Passive Income*), reading books like *The E-Myth Revisited*, and sacrificing hobbies for work. He dismisses ""balanced life"" narratives during wealth-building phases, noting most rich friends achieved balance only after securing wealth.  

**[19:44-25:34] Ali Abdaal's YouTube feed reflects what his priorities are**  
Ali analyzes his 2025 YouTube feed (gaming, philosophy, fitness) to show his shifted priorities post-wealth. He contrasts this with his 2020 feed (exclusively business content), illustrating how obsession evolves after financial success. He admits current ""side quests"" (art, gaming) are luxuries of already being rich.  

**[25:34-28:03] Misaligned goals between what you want and what you are doing creates misery**  
Concluding, Ali states that misaligned goals/actions cause unhappiness. He offers two choices: embrace obsession (adjust habits/content) or abandon the wealth goal. He frames financial ambition as morally neutral but stresses clarity to avoid regret, using his team members as examples of content non-wealth seekers.  

---

**Key Points:**  
- Wealth-building often demands an ""unhealthy obsession"" that sidelines other life areas temporarily.  
- Consistent focus (time, content consumption, habits) on financial goals is critical for success.  
- Misalignment between aspirations and actions leads to dissatisfaction; reconciliation is essential.  
- Societal judgment of financial ambition contrasts with acceptance of obsession in arts/sports.  
- Post-wealth ""balance"" is common, but rarely achievable during the wealth-building phase.  

**Tags:** wealth building, entrepreneurship, work-life balance, financial goals, obsession  

**Insight/Outlook:**  
The pursuit of wealth forces a trade-off between short-term imbalance and long-term freedom, requiring individuals to consciously choose their priorities or risk enduring dissatisfaction from unaligned goals."
